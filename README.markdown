Still working  on making the site more text-based and less element-based. I will need to take some time off for this deisgn to sink in and wait before making any more decisions. I like the way it looks now though.

Scratch that. Not really big changes because of the way my site is structured now, but it's slightly noticeable. I am working to incorporate Microsoft's attempt to make text the focal point of the application. Instead of having literal borders, spacing and sizing of text creates a natural feel. It's still a work in progress, but I really like that concept.

Done my final changes to the site. Unlikely to change any other parts of the site in the future unless I experience some stronger shifts. For now, this will be the base from which I will be building new layouts and features. Lots of work to get this site running. I hope it works!

Interesting correction. The correct branch to use was the Master branch because I want to use this site as a User page,
rather than a project page. Oops. I should read [the documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages)
more carefully.

I will use this readme document to mark down major changes on this website. I think that's the plan for now.

I recently deleted my Master branch to simplify my workflow, so there goes my commit history.
Hopefully I will make up for it by writing better commit descriptions from now on.

Let's start from scratch, again!
