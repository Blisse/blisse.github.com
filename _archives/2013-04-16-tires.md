I've always thought I was invincible.

I still do.

I read in the [daily mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2066354/The-Thatcher-gene-Scientists-discover-secret-internal-alarm-clock-allows-just-hours-sleep.html) that the recently deceased Magaret Thatcher could work on just 4 hours of sleep a night. That's insane. It's insane because I used to be able to do just that. Get by days with very minimal sleep, then take a good break on a weekend and be ready to go.

But I'm looking at the alternative and it looks a lot better. Rather than sleeping late, I get to bed earlier, and just manage my time a lot better to fit in everything I want in the day. Increase productivity, and get lots of sleep.

I've been trying this for the last couple weeks, but haven't been able to break the habit. Time to step on the pedal.

But still, I'm finally learning the limitations of stepping too hard on the pedal. Willpower is not an infinite resource. You need to conserve and reserve it if you need it in the future. If you plan on doing more than you can humanly handle, you better make sure your willpower is up to par, and it doesn't drain too badly, because your willpower is one of the most important weapons in your arsenal.

And as a plus, sleeping well supercharges your willpower.
