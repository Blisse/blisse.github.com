My favourite movie is *Silver Linings Playbook*. It's based off of the book of the same name. It's about a man with mental illness who snaps one day.

His personal motto is "Excelsior". It means, "ever upwards".

He believes that if you always work your hardest and do your best, you will be given a chance at finding a silver lining. And you can use that lining to work higher and higher to solve your problems.

It's a beautiful story.

It might not always work out in the end, but at the very least you can be proud of the choices you've made. And you might uncover something more beautiful in its place. Work on the things you don't like. Treasure the things you do. Work harder and better. Ever upwards. Higher and higher.
