        - "There once was an inflatable boy and an inflatable girl. They went to an inflatable school, where all the
            teachers were inflatable, all the buildings were inflatable, and all the students were inflatable."
        - "One day, the inflatable boy wondered - well, what if the whole world's inflatable? And what if everyone's
            inflatable and deflatable? And you know when you inflate someone, because they go like this
            **-happy face, rises up a bit-** and you know when you deflate someone, because they
            go like this **-sad face, droops down-**"

            if you can still inflate people after you're gone, then you've lived an even better one."
