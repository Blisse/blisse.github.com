about:
    - "Hi! My name is Victor Lai, and this is my site."
    - "I'm passionate about healthy **mental** and **physical health**, **happiness** and **helping others**, **mindfulness**, and **standing up**, for yourself and others."
    - "I love learning. I find it an amazing feeling to step back in awe of my progress so far. Try doing something with your non-dominant hand, like playing the guitar or using your mouse, and really see how much you've grown. I enjoy seeing my ideas and views being shaped by my the world. To that end, I'm always trying to find new things to do, or old things to enjoy with new friends."
    - "I made this blog to document and share some of my thoughts, so that I can look back and see the progress I've made. I update it with some of my new experiences, and bookmark content that I find interesting. Hopefully you'll find something useful as well. Feel free to let me know what you think, or ask me any questions."
    - "Send me a message if you have any questions. I'm always glad to help others."
