about_long: [
        "Hi! My name is Victor Lai. I'm a Software Engineering student
            at the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about product design,
            human-device interaction, and gaming",
        "I love learning, especially from my mistakes. I find it an amazing
            feeling to step back and look at my progress and dive in with a
            different perspective on how far you've come. Try doing something
            with your non-dominant hand and see how much work you've accomplished",
        "I enjoy seeing my ideas and views being shaped by my interactions with the world.
            When I'm not studying, I'm out expanding my abilities. This year I'm
            learning how to skate on ice, so I can eventually play hockey.
            Otherwise, I blog, read up on blogs, improve my programming, run, read,
            play games, and explore"
