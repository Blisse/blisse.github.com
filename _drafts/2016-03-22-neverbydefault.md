Today, I cut my bangs.

I've had this haircut for maybe 5 years. I found my barber 6 years ago, and I've been with him ever since. Same hairstyle. Same life.

I told him I wanted something *really* different.

I think it's time.

Today, I have finally ended the latest chapter in my life.

I promised myself that before university ended, I would have a final talk with my ex. That happened today randomly when we got on the same bus. It all started with her, and today it ended with her. That part of my life is over.

We talked for a while. I can see why I fell for her. It's another new experience. She has another boyfriend. Also a new experience for me. I really don't know what to feel.

She's changed a lot. So have I. But when we think of each other, we still think of the person we knew 4 years ago. And we just can't relate anymore. We don't actually know the person we're now sitting next to, and it feels weird to talk to them with that previous image in our mind. It's a bit sad.

We talked about our lives. Our new lives. Our new hobbies. Our old hobbies. Our old goals. Our new ones. The old us. The new you. The new me.

There's an awkward tension. We can't talk about the things we used to talk about. There's a trust you can only develop after being in a relationship. It's not there anymore. We can talk, and talk, and talk, but we can never talk... Maybe it's better this way.

I'm so happy and sad to have met and known her.

She said that she remembered my hair and all the effort with it.

So today, I cut my bangs. To be honest, my barber cut it a bit too short. I think I may have pointed at the wrong picture. But it's fine. It'll grow out. Life moves on.

We have to live with our decisions.

["Most lives are lived by default"](
http://www.raptitude.com/2012/07/most-lives-are-lived-by-default/) is my favourite article of all time. It's about making decisions.

I make the conscious decision to do things that scare me.

Some of these decisions are obviously good to do, and some of these decisions are obviously wrong. But there are a lot of decisions that we lie on the fence about. Our gut reaction is to take the easiest decision. To do whatever is safer or more familiar or more in line with who we are. But day by day, these decisions add up, and we sometimes come to a point where we make decisions because we made similar decisions in the past, or because it's easier, and these decisions truly affect who we are. It affects the hobbies we choose to try, the friends we make, the people we meet, the skills we learn, and the way we see the world.

That's why I fight for these decisions as much as I can.

When I'm on the fence about something, I try to force myself to just do it. That's how rock climbing started. A friend asked me to join, I was like, "uhhhhh no thanks", but then I made myself say, "wait, yes let's do it". It's how I learned to skate. I want to play hockey, but there were too many things to figure out and too much equipment and practice schedules to follow. So the next time I was at a sports store, I forced myself to buy a pair of skates, and now I'm committed. It's how I joined a bunch of random clubs and a bunch of random hobbies. And how I subsequently quit them when I realized they weren't right for me.

The point hasn't been to find something I'm passionate about. It's to figure out what works for me, because me changes everyday. Instead of letting my hobbies and my preferences be decided by whatever default or whatever fear, I can actually try it with an open mind and make a real, informed, conscious decision.

I will fight my default decision every time to make sure that I make the choices that align me better with the person I want to be.

Instead of ignoring my ex forever, I made the decision that I don't want to be that kind of person, so I fought my feelings and worked it out.

Instead of taking the easiest path, I try to do what really scares me the most, because at the end of the day (or week, or month, or year), I know that the scarier option will bring me a little bit closer to what I want, and I know that taking the scarier road will give me a little bit more courage to continue fighting for what I believe in.
