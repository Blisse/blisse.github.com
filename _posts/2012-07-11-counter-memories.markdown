  Sometimes, the oddest of circumstances makes you remember things you did in 
  the past, that somehow you forgot over the years. And most of the time, it puts a 
  really big smile on your face when you think about how simple times were.
</p>

<p> 
  I was having an innocent argument with an artist about stuff that we've made in the 
  past. While my friend is clearly the better artist between the two of us, I remembered
  that I really wanted to be a (graphic) artist at some point in my life.
</p>

<p>
  Since Grade 5 or 6, I have always been the biggest Counter-Strike fan, until some 
  tragic event a couple of years ago that forced me to quit. I played a lot of Counter-Strike, 
  so I'm pretty sure my 662 HOURS PLAYED on Steam is inaccurate. In my spare time then, 
  I thought about Counter-Strike a lot. Fiddled with the backend graphics; new scripts, new models,
  new decals.

  My Grade 9 Art mark was an astounding 100, a surprise, even to myself. I think my 
  Art teacher had a lot of hope in me, and was probably a little heartbroken when me 
  and my friend (who also got 100), decided not to take Grade 10 Art.

  I had before stumbled upon a thriving online game modding community in 
  <a href="http://www.fpsbanana.com" target="_blank">FPSBanana</a>. I was hooked.
  I vividly remember seeing <a href="http://gamebanana.com/members/164481" target="_blank">Teh Snake</a>.
  He made many brilliant and amazing mods, and quite possibly the reason I wanted to go into graphic design.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually, I tried my hand at modding, and upon realizing I hadn't the talent or the experience,
  I tried something much, much easier, and something that brings me a little bit of joy to see online now.

  I made a custom hand skin for Counter-Strike after collaborating a bit with the original owner, Nasaratsu.
  Here's the <a href="http://gamebanana.com/cscz/skins/48319" target="_blank">link</a>, and while it's 
  really bad, I'm still extremely proud of it. Over 6,000 downloads, and 14,000 views. :')
