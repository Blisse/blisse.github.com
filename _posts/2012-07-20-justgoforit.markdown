  A little change of tone from my usually more laid back posts.
</p>

<p>
  When people ask for motivation, it's really hard to give them a straight answer. 
  I never had one myself. But recently, I've had some really horrid problems that 
  left me scratching my head. I couldn't solve it, and there was nothing I could do.
</p>

<p>
  But then I came along a couple of really good motivational posts, which really,
  in essence, told me to do it because failure is not an option. Mediocrity is not an option.
</p>

<p>
  And that's what I've always believed in. My motivation was always really, 
  "Do it because you can. Do it to prove to yourself that you can. 
  Do it 100% because when it's all over, you're still an insignificant speck,
  unless your 100% is better than his." 
</p>

<p>
  Talk about an inferiority complex going on here.
</p>

<p>
  But I realized, I grew into a habit of accepting mediocrity. It might be because the university 
  system forces this down our throats a bunch, and some life-changing realizations I've made since 
  expanding my horizons. And it may be, just because. 
</p>

<p>
  I shouldn't be making excuses for my failures, because there isn't time in life to do this.
</p>

<p>
  60sec * 60min * 24hr * 365.25days * 100 yrs = NOT ENOUGH
</p>

<p>
  Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. And there goes so much precious time. Not enough time to sit back and 
  let something like, motivation, run your life. Do it because you can, and because you want to 
  be the best at it. 
</p>

<p>
  Screw motivation. Just go for it.
