  When people ask for motivation, it's really hard to give them a straight answer. 
  I never had one myself. But recently, I've had some really bad problems that 
  left me scratching my head. I couldn't solve it, and there was nothing I could do.
</p>

<p>
  But then I came along a couple of really good motivational posts, which really,
  in essence, told me to do it because failure is not an option. Mediocrity is not an option.
</p>

<p>
  And that's what I've always believed in. My motivation was always really, 
  "Do it because you can. Do it to prove to yourself that you can. 
  Do it 100% because when it's all over, you're still an insignificant speck,
  unless your 100% is better than his." Talk about an inferiority complex going on here.
</p>

<p>
  But I realized, I grew into a habit of accepting mediocrity. It might be because the university 
  system forces this down our throats a bunch, and some life-changing realizations I've made since. 
  I shouldn't be making excuses for my failures, because there isn't time in life to do this.

</p>

<p>
  I can't let one little thing set me back so much of that time. Just as much as I can't do something
  50%, and then complain about it later on.
</p>

<p>
  Screw getting the motivation. I'll just do it.

  "You need to ask yourself, 'what are you going to do today,' <br />
  but more importantly, 'how are you going to do it.'"
