When people ask for motivation, it's really hard to give them a straight answer.
I never had one myself. But recently, I've had some really bad problems that
left me scratching my head. I couldn't solve it, and there was nothing I could do.

But then I came along a couple of really good motivational posts, which really,
in essence, told me to do it because failure is not an option. Mediocrity is not an option.
You don't have the time to be mediocre, because every second spent fixing your mediocrity
is a second not spent getting ahead.

My motivation was always really,

<blockquote>
  <p>
  	"Do it because you can. Do it to prove to yourself that you can.
  	Do it 100% because when it's all over, you don't matter unless you're better than the rest."
  </p>
</blockquote>

But as the time passed by, I began to realize that I grew into a habit of.. mediocrity. It might be because the education
system doesn't really teach, and some life-changing realizations I've made since.
But I shouldn't be making excuses for my failures, because there isn't time in life to do this.

I can't let one little thing, one little portion of my life, set me back so much of that time. Just as much as I can't do something
50%, and then complain about it later on.

Screw the motivation. Just do it.

This is a pretty rose-tinted view of it, but a little bit applicable at least [The Best Motivation](http://youtu.be/Sk56VxaeqEQ).

My favourite quote?

<blockquote>
  <p>
  "You need to ask yourself, 'what are you going to do today,' <br />
  but more importantly, 'how are you going to do it.'"
