  <a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> just saved me weeks of pain, so here it goes.
</p>

<p>
  If the Dropbox introduction video doesn't convince you, here is my real world use of Dropbox.
</p>


<p>
  I'm a University student that lives away from home. I decided to bring my desktop to my new residence. 
</p>

<p>
  I use some slightly confusing system with GitHub and Dropbox, so
  I had to learn some new stuff so that I could upload my website properly to GitHub Pages.
  The first time I tried it, I actually deleted my website files, along with the 
  GitHub repository. I had nothing to roll back to. It was all gone.
</p>

<p>
  But I was saved! Before this, I had always debated whether to put the website source files in my Dropbox folder, so I could
  work on it and sync my files across my computers, or if trying this system was a bit too complicated. Luckily for me, I left it on my Dropbox this time.

  When I accidentally deleted my website files, I panicked. But I found out that Dropbox saves a history of your deleted
  files, so that you can recover them if you're messed up accidentally, and actually use them as a mini-version
  tracker. Awesome for a free service. Thank you very much Dropbox, for saving a couple days' or weeks' worth of material. 
  Kind of an amazing application.
