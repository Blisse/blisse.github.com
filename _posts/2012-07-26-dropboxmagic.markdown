  I love <a href="www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Because I use some slightly more complicated system with GitHub and Dropbox, 
  I had to learn some new stuff so that I could upload my website properly to GitHub Pages.
</p>

<p>
  In the process of doing so, I actually accidentally deleted my website files, along with the 
  GitHub repository. I had nothing to roll back to. It was all gone.
</p>

<p>
  POOF!
</p>

<p>
  But to my joy, I always debated whether to put the website source in my Dropbox, so I could
  work on it and sync my files from my Windows laptop to my Ubuntu laptop to my Windows desktop 
  to my work desktop. 
</p>

  When I accidentally deleted my website files, I thank that Dropbox saves a history of your deleted
  files, so that you can recover them if they go accidentally, and actually use them as a mini-version
  tracker. Awesome for a free service.

  Thank you very much Dropbox, for saving a couple days' or weeks' worth of material. Thank you.
