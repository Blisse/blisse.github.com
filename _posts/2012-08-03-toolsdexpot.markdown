  When I first used Ubuntu, I fell in love with graphical 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workspace#Graphical_interfaces" target="_blank">workspaces</a>.
  The ability to open and manage multiple desktops was a great implementation when you only have one monitor. 
  The controls were intuitive, the  transitions were clean and delays were non-existent. 
  It was an amazing discovery.
</p>

<p>
  I later found out that Apple's OS X has the Expose and Spaces for their own version of workspaces. 
  It is noticeably faster, more responsive and applied better features, as expected on the very well 
  designed Mac OS. As a Windows user primarily however, I felt very left out.
</p>

<p>
  After a lot of searching, I found the solution. <a href="http://dexpot.de/" target="_blank">Dexpot</a>
</p>

<p>
  They've made a lot of improvements since I've first time I used it, and right now, it's evolved into something
  beautiful. They've added much better taskbar integration, a less buggy multi-monitor support, and much, much better 
  responsiveness overall. It's a great product with a great team behind it.

<p>
  Simply put, virtual desktops allow one to swap between screens. 
</p>

<p>
  The main benefit is clutter. Spacing out several applications over four screens is great, similar to the benefits
  of using multiple monitors. It means you can categorize your workspaces, one section for reference applications, 
  one side for working programs, and another area for anything else.
</p>

<p>
  Keeping the programs maximized like this means the program is almost always active. Minimizing and maximizing is 
  a drag, while with Dexpot or any virtual desktop application, pressing a customized key combination, say ALT+1 or 
  ALT+2, will swap the active applications to a new set. It's much more convenient.

  The difference in productivity is pretty astounding. Give it a go <a href="http://dexpot.de/?id=download" target="_blank">here</a>.
