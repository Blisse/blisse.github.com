I recently gained possession of a really nice pair of cables. 1/4" male to 1/4" male. Nothing special really, except the cable feels really nice.

I have a pair of [Blue Dragon](http://www.moon-audio.com/audio-cables/moon-audio-headphone-cables/moon-audio-blue-dragon-headphone-cable.html) cables from Moon-Audio. Apparently it's surrounded by Kevlar and Teflon tape. Yum. That link isn't the same pair, but it's close. It feels like a really high quality braided cable. All newer Razer peripherals come braided with a [cloth like material](http://cdn.theendearingdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Razer-Naga-Gaming-Mouse-Review14.jpg). It feels nice, but the Blue Dragon cable is less flexible, with a really strong and plasticky feel.

It feels amazing.

My new cable feels even better. It's completely rubberized, which isn't something I've seen a lot. The rubber is really textured, unlike the smooth plasticky rubber on a lot of cables. It's made by Fender, and says Professional Noiseless Cable on the cable itself. I don't know why that message is required. Isn't that expected of every cable?

Oh well. It feels so nice I don't mind.
