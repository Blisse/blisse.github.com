  I recently got to level 95 in Tetris Friends Battle 2P and 6P, so here's some Tetris. ^^
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> is somewhat of a famous game. Most people who've played it probably first
  started on the GameBoy. Maybe something like this.

  Nowadays, <a href="http://www.tetrisfriends.com/" target="_blank">Tetris Friends</a> is all the rage. 
  And for good reason.
</p>

<p>
  They have a monopoly on the casual Tetris scene, being the exclusive licensee of Tetris in North America and Europe. They have a dedicated site and a much better app on Facebook. 
  Actually, it probably wouldn't be very wrong to say that Tetris Friends is the reason Tetris has experienced a recent resurgence.
</p>

<p>
  The Tetris Friends has several game modes in both Single Player and Multiplayer. Marathon, where you try to clear as many lines as possible,
  to Sprint 5P, where you play 3 others to finish 40 lines in the fastest time, to Battle 2P, where you battle another player and score KOs. 
  It's really addicting, smooth, and in general just very fun to play. 
</p>

<p>
  My main experience is with the Multiplayer Battle 2P and 6P modes, so that's where I'll start.

</p>

<p>
  In May, one of my high school friends saw me playing Tetris, and asked me for a match. I hadn't seen him in a while, so why not.
  In short, he crushed me. Long version? He REALLY crushed me. I actually thought I was decent. He was Level 100, literally a Tetris God.
  I vowed that day to get to a point where I could compete toe-to-toe with him. At least, somewhere toe-to-toe. It was a game, and it was a 
  fun challenge. My favourite kind.
</p>

<p>
  Over the last 3 months, I played Tetris Friends pretty ritually. After work, a couple hours. On the weekends, a couple hours. Nothing too crazy,
  but it got me really into the game, and to a point where I could starting seeing a vast improvement over my newbie self from May. It was very rewarding to see
  this effort and determination turning into something real. Yay!
</p>

<p>
  Battle 2P is the most competitive game mode. You play another player from around the world,
  send as many lines as possible to the other player, and hope you KO them more than they do to you. To send lines, you'll have to perform combos. 
  Along the way, you'll also have to clear the lines that your opponent sends to you by clearing the bombs away. It's complicated,
  but play a few times and you'll get the gist of it. Here's a image I found off Google off a couple of newer players going at it.

  Starting off, I was pretty bad, but I knew how to improve, and I set about playing only for that purpose.
  Knowing how to improve was really important. There's a lot of players that are really amazing at some parts of the game, but say, play a bad style, and that hinders
  their improvement. There isn't really an exact skill ceiling for this game since you can play at blistering speeds. But having a bad strategy will harm your development
  in the long run. I was fortunate enough to be able to visualize this kind of improvement plan for myself, and able to watch it unfold.
</p>

<p>
  Most players in the game know of only one way to play. I will refer to this as the 1-line style. Since the game board is 10 spaces across, they'll fill up
  9 of those spaces as high as possible, leaving 1 space at the left or right side, while saving up the I-piece, then drop it once for 
  a Tetris, and again for a Back-to-Back Tetris. This is pretty good for low levels, and solid enough to help develop your building skills. 
  But definitely, it's the worst way to play.
</p>

<p>
  I will save the strategic discussions my next post. And later I'll try to pinpoint in a later exactly why Tetris Friends is so good. From a development point of view of course.
