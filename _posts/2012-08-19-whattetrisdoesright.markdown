  I recently got to level 95 in Tetris Friends Battle 2P and 6P, so here's some Tetris.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> is somewhat of a famous game. Most people who've played it probably first
  started on the GameBoy. Maybe something like this.

<p>
  Nowadays, <a href="http://www.tetrisfriends.com/" target="_blank">Tetris Friends</a> is all the rage. 
  And for good reason.
</p>

<p>
  They sort of have a monopoly on the casual Tetris scene, being the licensee in North America. They have a dedicated site and an app on Facebook. 
  And actually, it probably wouldn't be wrong to say that Tetris Friends is the reason Tetris has gotten a recent resurgence.
</p>

<p>
  The Tetris Friends has several game modes in both Single Player and Multiplayer. Marathon, where you try to clear as many lines as possible,
  to Sprint 5P, where you play 3 others to finish 40 lines in the fastest time, to Battle 2P, where you battle another player and score KOs.
</p>

<p>
  My main experience is with the Multiplayer Battle modes, so that's where my point of view will be from.
</p>

<p>
  In May, one of my high school friends saw me playing Tetris, and asked me for a match. I hadn't seen him in a while, so why not.
  In short, he crushed me. Long version, he REALLY crushed me. I thought I was decent. He was Level 100, literally a Tetris God (more on that later).
  I vowed that day to get to a point where I could compete toe-to-toe with him. At least, somewhere toe-to-toe. It was a game, and it was a 
  fun challenge. My favourite kind.
</p>

<p>
  Over the last 3 months, I played Tetris Friends pretty religiously. After work, a couple hours. On the weekends, a couple hours. Nothing too crazy,
  but it got me really into the game, and to a point where I could see a vast improvement over my nooby May self. It was very rewarding to realize
  that putting this determination into something actually paid off. Yay!
</p>

<p>
  I said my main experience was on Battle 2P and Battle 6P. Battle 2P is the most... competitive game mode. You play another player from around the world,
  send as many lines as possible to the other player, and hope you KO them more than they do to you. To send lines, you'll have to perform combos, either 
  consecutively or with a T-spin. Along the way, you'll also have to clear the lines that your opponent sends to you by clearing the bombs away. It's complicated,
  but play a few times and you'll get the gist of it. Here's a image I found off Google.

<p> 
  Starting off, you'll be pretty bad, but if you play well and know how to improve, you'll do fine. At least I did.
  Notice that knowing how to improve is really important. There's a lot of players that are really good, but really good with a bad style, and that hinders
  their improvement. Theoretically, your skill ceiling is near limitless in this game, when you play as faster as your computer can process. But realistically, 
  it slows down to a crawl once you've exhausted your play style.
</p>

<p>
  Most players in the game know of only one way to play. I will refer to this as the 1-line style. Since the board is 10 spaces across, they'll fill up
  9 of those spaces as high as possible (preferably leaving the 1 space at the left or right side), while saving up the I-piece, then drop it twice for 
  a Tetris, then a Back-to-Back Tetris. This is pretty good for low levels, and it's so simple, it'll help develop your building skills faster. 
</p>

<p> 
  But definitely, it's the worst way to play.
</p>

<p>
  Before I move on, I want to focus on some essential "pillars" of playing Battle Tetris. <br />
	- Opening <br />
	- Build-up <br />
	- Combos <br />
	- Anticipation <br />
	- Bomb Clearing <br />
	- Ending <br />
  Well, that's a lot of new stuff. Let's take a look at the important ones
</p>

<p>
  The opening is really irrelevant for low levels of play. Once you get higher, the opening could score you lots of easy points, and set you up for the entire game.
  Contrary to popular belief, anticipating your opponent really isn't necessary until the higher levels. By simply out-performing your opponent, you can win very easily.
  Similarly, bomb clearing is unnecessary. If you play well, taking the KO means you can combo longer. The ending is also unnecessary. While you want to finish
  with as few blocks as possible, only the highest level players care about it.
</p>

<p>
  So we're left with build-up and combos. Build-up describes the speed and accuracy of how high you can get your stack. If you build-up very well, you have very
  solid mechanics, don't make many mistakes, understand what to look for in your stack, make good decisions on-the-fly, understand patterns, look several moves ahead, 
  and perform at great pace. This is the main focus of Tetris Friends. Building a solid foundation so you can do the wacky things you want. Most often though, this is 
  limited by the second part, combos.
</p>

<p>
  Combo-ing is the act of sending lines to your opponent to KO them. You can achieve this several ways. One way is the Back-to-Back Tetris I mentioned earlier, in which
  you have two I-pieces in a row and you Tetris twice with a stack greater than 8 rows high. However, a golden principle to note is that if you're combo-ing, you want to 
  use as few lines per piece as possible. With a Tetris, every piece (I-piece) you use, will use up 4 lines of your stack. This is not good, because bonuses get much, much higher
  when you maintain a long consecutive combo. That is, if every piece you use clears at least one line, and you use more than 1 piece. 
</p>

<p>
  This is where me saying that the 1-line style is bad. Thinking about it, the ratio of time spent building up the stack versus the amount of lines sent to your opponent, 
  is definitely way too low. Beginners are a lot better matched to play the 2-line style, where you build up in 8 spaces, leaving a 2 space gap on a side of your stack,
  then dropping pieces to form a combo. You can easily get an 8 or 9 combo after a few tries, which is much better, and time effective than 1-line. And it means you can
  attack your opponent (by sending lines), at almost any point you feel like it. 2-line seems to counter 1-line pretty well, but it still depends largely on your speed.
  I will continue on in my next post.
