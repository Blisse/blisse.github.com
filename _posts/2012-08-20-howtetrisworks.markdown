  To get better, you must get worse. That's very true if you've started off in a bad style, and need to move to another one. 
  No one is immediately amazing at every new thing they try, so don't be discouraged. You must also keep an open mind to your style
  so that you can recognize the implications of playing how you play. 
</p>

<p>
  I'll point out the most common idea that should come up. Last part, I mentioned that people only know one way to play. People in that mindset
  don't want to get out of it because "it's hard," or "I don't like the way it feels." Thus they allow themselves to settle for a sub-standard style.
  Fine for casual gaming, not fine for improvement. Often, they don't realize the simple fact that comboing consecutively is a lot better than
  a Tetris or back-to-back Tetris. That's a realization most players make when they transition out of it.
</p>

<p>
  Only from that point do you realize that if you can maximize the effectiveness of each piece during a combo, you'll fare much better off. 
  And that's how you realize what's possible moving forward. 
</p>

  The 2-line style is the best style to improve, I think. Playing this well will get you from 10-60 easily. The beauty lies in the 2 block empty spaces.
  When you throw your pieces in there, every piece is guaranteed to make at least one line, bar the I-piece. This means 7 combos are now available at the minimum,
  and when you play more, even 13 combos are a possibility when you add in bomb clearing.
</p>

  In Tetris, you definitely do not want to make mistakes. A single mistake can throw off your game. Two mistakes in a row 
  will crush you when you're at higher levels. So it's a good idea to start learning proper technique. Lots of players focus on speed
  and speed alone. When they get near to the end of the match, all of that goes to hell. Concentration breaks and mistakes happen.
  What potentially could've been another 10-20 lines sent all ends because they made one mistake that may have cost them the break.
  What's the most important rule then? Pacing. 
</p>

<p>
  You need to play at a consistently good pace the entire game. That way, your entire game stabilizes, and you won't lose simply because
  you messed up once. I've been in many situations where my opponent gets 2 points ahead because they anticipated my moves, but then they can't 
  keep up a solid style and I end up winning 3-2, simply because I'm playing to not make mistakes, not for attacking opportunities.

  Once you reach a level where you can build up carelessly, then you can take quick peeks at your opponent's stack, and with that stack, peek at their
  incoming pieces. This is when those other pillars start to join in. You want to develop your core game, then add these little boosts. And because you 
  have such a strong core, it's super easy to incorporate it, and you'll reap the benefits much better.
