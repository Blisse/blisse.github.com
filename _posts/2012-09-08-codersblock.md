I'm working on my Poker game, and it's always the same story.

I always find that the hardest part is not the logic, but getting it playable. I seem to always be torn between optimizing now so that I don't write horrible code for future me to debug, and just getting it down. It's starting to get really annoying. It's like some form of writer's block; for programmers. There's just so much I want to do and so little time to do it, I'm stuck deciding what to do instead of just going for it.

I think my best plan of attack is to just make it playable as soon as possible. I don't think I should worry about optimizing now, even if it means I'll have a harder job in the future. Hey, it'd be good experience to weed through really, really bad code.
