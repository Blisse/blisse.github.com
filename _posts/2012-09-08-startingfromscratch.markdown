  I'm working on my Poker game, and it's always the same story.
</p>

<p>
  I always find that the hardest part is not the logic, but getting down a 
  workable and playable structure. I seem to always be torn between optimizing 
  now so that I don't write horrible code for future me and just getting it down, so
  it's starting to get really stiffling.
</p>

<p>
  I guess my best plan of attack is to just brain storm the entire process out by hand
  so I can visual the pieces that I need to put in place, and then implement that as soon
  as possible. I don't think I really need to worry about optimizing now, even if it means 
  I'll have a harder job in the future. Hey, it'd be good experience.
