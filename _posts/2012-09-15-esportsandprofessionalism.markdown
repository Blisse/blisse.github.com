<p>
	I'm a big fan of the electronic sports (e-sports) movement. For the last 10 years, gamers have been pushing the idea
	that gaming isn't that different from soccer or basketball. People who play at an extremely high level, the "professionals", 
	deserve a chance to make playing the game a job rather than just a hobby. And it's working.
</p>

<p>
	Really it sounds ridiculous, but in Korea, the game Starcraft has over the last 10 years really ingrained itself in 
	the Korean consciousness. Progamers, as they're called, compete in televised live events, with the top tier earning easily 100K USD,
	and cheered on by mobs of fans, male and female alike. Yes, these are gamers. 
</p>

<p>
	StarCraft 2, the sequel to the iconic StarCraft and Starcraft: Brood War hopes to emulate this success, but now heavily
	involving the Western audience. Korea was the place to be for StarCraft. The Koreans dominated completely, and they still do in 
	the sequel. The only difference is that now, they're much more open to the Western competitors, and it's not as one-sided as before.
</p>

<p>
	Many, many people really want e-sports to kick off for the West. Hours spent gaming overnight could actually be a productive use of time, 
	and a promising career. It's a very enviable vision, but it is really hindered by the immature nature of gaming. 
</p>

<p>
	Gaming involves, for a large part, having fun. At the highest levels, it doesn't become fun anymore after the 12 hour daily training regime.
	But for the general Western audience, which already has a low maturity level, the fun is really evident. The commentators for the games who 
	call out the shots not only look shabby much of the time, but talk casually. The players are immature and the scene is rife with controversy.
	Hardly the environment for a sport to thrive.
</p>

<p>
	The difference? The layer of professionalism that all sports uphold.
</p>

<p>
	Commentators do not snigger at the players. They do not obviously favour one side. They do not introduce their pets or their hobbies.
	Players speak sufficient English. They dress well and handle themselves with care. Image matters, even if some would convince themselves otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	Counter-Strike was really the West's copy of StarCraft, on a much much lower scale. Many names are very recognizable to followers, and 
	many top gamers were involved in the game or with sponsors even after retiring. The difference? They look the part.
</p>

<p> 
	<a href="http://youtu.be/VWOIgB37LKQ" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice video of one of the greatest Counter-Strike players, Heaton.
	While he is undoubtedbly a great gamer, he also looks like a strong role model. <a href="http://white-ra.com/" target="_blank">White-Ra</a> is a 
	great representative of this attitude for StarCraft, highly contrasting from the high profile but more controversial Western figures. He is always 
	polite, always looks after himself, and always professional. Amazing guy really.
</p>

<p>
	And if StarCraft wants to persist, they'll do much better to have people like White-Ra as role models and leaders, because even now, the typical 
	gamer is still seen as overweight/underweight, disheveled and immature.
