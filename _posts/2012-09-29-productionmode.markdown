<p>
  Eventually, I want to get this website to some sort of, "production mode",
  where I can stop focussing on creating content for this site, learning 
  HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, and instead begin focussing on blogging. 
</p>
<p>
  It's been great experience learning how to program for the future in a sense, because
  I have to constantly make sure my CSS3 is readible for me to make super fast adjustments
  later on, or that my site layout makes sense so that finding files is simple. 
  Hopefully, I'll be able to apply these skills to my future development posts. 
</p>
<p>
  However, I am very glad to be learning all of these new programming tools, Jekyll, Git,
  Liquid, Markdown, Pygments, jQuery and many more. I really want to experience all of the
  development, the programming, the tools, the add-ons around me, but there isn't enough
  time. I really want to bunk down these next 7 months, study hard and work hard so I can
  do all of these things that I want to do, like program a Flash UI for my Cowon J3,
  or add some Windows 8 no-longer-Metro-style tiles and icons to my website. 
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, I'll be working hard to post some more content on this site. Upcoming? 
  A gallery of the site's "aesthetic" progression, Windows 8 tiles, and a multi-level
  navigation menu! Also, hopefully I'll figure out a way to make a nice mobile version.
  The current site is just skeleton'd into the correct proportions at the moment. Nothing 
  really "mobile". But I'll fix that.
