	So apparently <a href="http://maruku.rubyforge.org/changelog.html#stable">Maruku</a> hasn't been developed in over 3 years. The last GEM release was <a href="http://maruku.rubyforge.org/changelog.html#stable">version 0.6.0 in 2009-05-04</a>.

	So I've been using an outdated markdown parser for the last half year on this blog. Joy. Moved immediately to RDiscount, and it's fixed the most annoying bug from Maruku: my code doesn't display tabs as 8 spaces anymore. Looks a lot cleaner, I think.
