	My university is decently funded, so across the campus, there are a lot of lab stations where groups of students can sit by a computer and work on
	their assignments, or for those without a computer at home, just surf the web freely. Everyday, the most popular lab areas are always nearly full. Students can bring their laptops and set up a little study area around one of the lab computers, or take a small island of tables and work in a group. It's really convenient.
</p>

<p>
	I sometimes visit these labs. I enjoy the environment and atmosphere. There's a quiet respect for everyone in the area, with a couple exceptions. Something I hate, but is necessary, is that they bolt the machines and monitors to the tables, so I can't hook the monitor to my laptop as a second screen, but it's not that much of a loss with workspaces and <a href="http://localhost:4000/archive/2012/08/03/index.html">Dexpot</a>. However, something else always bugged me when I was at the labs, and today I finally realized what it was.

<p>
	<div class="subheader">
		Either the chairs are too low, or the tables are too high.
	</div>
</p>

<p>
	I didn't think I would notice, but I did. Ergonomics are always a concern of mine. I actually thought I had developed RSI a couple years ago when my wrists ached constantly. It turned out my wrists were just digging into the edge of the table too much, but it did make me much more aware of how my desk positioned my body throughout the day.
</p>

<p>
	Well, I can safely say that the tables and chairs in the common lab room promote abhorrent posture. According to and not limited by all the following sources, your arm should form an angle greater than 90 degrees at the elbow, and the upper arm should be horizontal to the floor. Your legs should be flat on the floor, and your back to the chair.

	<div class="subheader">
		Guess how many sites recommend sitting in the position the E5 lab promotes? 
		<br/>...
		<br/>None.

<p>
	 That's it then. I guess I will have to see what rooms actually condone proper ergonomics. Along the way I might creep some people out, but some things must be sacrificed in the sake of the science. <span class="bold">*cough*</span> I'll keep you posted after I scour UWaterloo for some good seats.
