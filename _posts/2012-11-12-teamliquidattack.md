	Awesome! I was a bit busy with school work a couple weeks ago, but I managed to watch the <a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/TeamLiquid:_Attack!">TeamLiquid Attack!</a> episode with <a href="http://white-ra.com/">White-Ra</a>.
</p>

<p>
	TeamLiquid Attack! is a Starcraft show where professional Starcraft gamers come play against community members as a sort of fan service. Guest casters, usually other community members, stream the matches to the community. If you want to play against them, you have to guess a trivia question they ask on the stream, or be really really lucky like I was.

	<a href="http://youtu.be/Mg19xi2vERA?t=33m49s">Here I am</a> in the final game, a 3v3 against iNcontroL, CatZ and White-Ra. I'm the Zerg player who kills the Probe. :D

	I was actually too nervous during the entire game because I was freaking out since I never win anything and kind of starstruck. I think I was screaming like a fangirl the entire time. It was so awesome.
