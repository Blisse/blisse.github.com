      I don't know where this came from, but most of the time, it's true.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      You have to get worse before you get better.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      That applies for almost everything that's worth fighting for. If all we experienced was happiness, we would never appreciate the true extent of happiness because we do not have the perspective of the other side.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding and accepting this helps a lot in self-improvement. When you are down, you realize that everyone else has been down before, and it has always turned out alright. When you can't do it, you realize that if you do finally do it, the feeling of success will be beyond description.
    </p>

    <p>
      Accepting that you're bad goes a long way in improving yourself to not be as bad. It's like every sport. Sooner or later, you realize that you're only good at the district level, and that there's thousands of people at the provincial level, and tens of thousands in the national level and international levels that would stomp on you any day, and that's not including all the people who play very well, but not competitively.
    </p>

    <p>
      So once you hit that road block, you can either sit down and accept your fate, or push yourself forward, for a little more pain. Because that's what it takes.
    </p>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
      The thing that gets most people is motivation. What's the point of doing better? Shouldn't I worry about X instead? (where X is making friends, having fun, etc)
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, yes, you should worry about all of those; if you don't want to improve. You may say that this activity is entirely superficial. I have this goal that I want to work towards with this activity, that is directly contradictory to improvement. Then, yes, go for it. But why would you? How is improvement ever detrimental? How is making yourself stronger, faster, more prepared, more athletic, more nimble, more concentrated, more anything ever detrimental?
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Pain is temporary. Success is forever.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In my eyes, I never see a reason I should be bad at something if I can do something about it. Why settle for anything that's less than perfect? Why live a life where you are just, mediocre. Why not aim as high as you can? When do you have anything to lose when you try your best at everything you do. Feel the pain, but reap the rewards.
    </p>

    <p>
      And I try not to make excuses about being bad either. If I screw up, then I screwed up. If I didn't work hard enough, then I didn't work hard enough. I lose because my opponent did everything better. And I know that I can definitely be at the same level as he or she, if I worked harder.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Life is hard work. Improvement is hard work. You are only limited by yourself.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      At least, that's the attitude I once had. Now I'm working my way back up there. And above.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      You are bad, so deal with it.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Accepting that you are bad means that you understand that your way of thinking is incorrect; sub-optimal. That means you have to accept new methods and form new habits over what you have been doing before.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's a tough process. But I like to think that the tougher it is, the more that final goal is worth fighting for.
