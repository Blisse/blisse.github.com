So, I disappeared for a few months. Listed some goals and then ran off. That's okay, because I've been busy.

This site got a facelift. I think I'm finally satisfied with the way it turned out. Now I can focus on adding some cool features instead of mmm-ing over the theme.

I went over a lot of my CSS and re-structured it. As in, I re-did the entire site HTML structure, and began using SASS instead of CSS. SASS is gosh-darn powerful, I must say, and I regret not using it from the start.
