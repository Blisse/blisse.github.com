			A couple weeks ago I finally released my app to the Windows Phone app store. And then I got a bunch of emails telling me my app was going to be featured in select regions on certain dates! And when I took a look, AWESOME, I SEE MY APP!

			And then I took a look at my app's status and I just hit 500+ downloads! YEAH! :D Awesomesauce.
