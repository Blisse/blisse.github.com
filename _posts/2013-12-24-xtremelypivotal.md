	* Finished Final Fantasy XIII
	* Middle of The Last of Us (wow this game)
* Programmed in new languages
	* Developed and released a Windows Phone 8 app from scratch
	* Started iOS7 development
	* Released my personal Windows Phone 8 app.
		* 500 downloads on personal app (awesome!)
		* Finished the workout program my app described
	* Contributed to a huge legacy Android app
* Read (A LOT)
    * Caught up in The Dresden Files (books 1-11)
    * Read the first 10 books in Wild Cards series
	* Started Asimov's Foundation series
* Found way too much music
	* I'm serious I think I have a problem
* Learned to play new games
	* 8-ball pool
	* foosball
* Went to the gym for 3 months straight
	* Bench 100lbs.
	* Deadlift 150lbs.
	* Squat 150lbs.
	* Lateral pull-down 100lbs.
	* Seated row 2x50lbs.
	* Gained 20lbs in weight 
* Met lots of new friends

It feels nice to be conscious of changes like these. 

It's also Christmas Eve so time to reminisce a bit. I distinctly remember telling myself that I would work on being happier last Christmas Eve, and that I wouldn't let myself end up in the same place I was next year.
