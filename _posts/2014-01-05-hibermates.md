I helped fund a Kickstarter back in October 2013 for the [Hibermate, the world's first super-soft ear muff for sleeping](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dpbaileys/the-worlds-first-super-soft-ear-muff-for-sleeping). They finally came 2-3 weeks ago and I've had a good go at them, so here are my thoughts.

## Expectations

A long long long time ago when I was a kid, we took a pair of eye masks from a Cathay Pacific Airlines flight. I tried to use them every once in a while, but they never seemed to feel that great. So all my sleeping is done without anything really near my face.

I bought these masks for two reasons:

* To remove ambient noise when I'm sleeping
* To sleep more comfortably

The eye mask was a bonus because it blocks out light very well. However, I have some mods on most of my lighted electronics that make my room as dark as possible, so I didn't need the extra blackness the mask would provide.

From their promotional video, I expected a really comfortable product that blocked out sound very well.


## Reality
