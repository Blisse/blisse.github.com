So it's been 2 weeks. I think I'm already overworked. I thought I had a weekend to catch up but I was stuck on one assignment, and now multiple (>3) things are due per week, plus a couple large projects and sizable quizzes that are kind of scaring me. 

I need to find some time to clear my head and study a lot more and a lot harder. First, work my ass off to get the rest of this week in. Then, rest.

Also, we finished job applications through the school's busted website. Hopefully I get a chance to interview with the companies I want. I'm looking at you Microsoft.
