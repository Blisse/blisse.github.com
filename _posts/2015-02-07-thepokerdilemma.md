I've loved poker since I was a kid. Mainly because I loved playing cards as a kid (lots of Big 2, Go Fish, Uno, Crazy Eights, Bridge), but also because I watched a lot of tv and somehow ended up watching poker whenever it was on ESPN or Sportsnet.

One of the cool things about poker is how big it's become. Internet poker was actually a small thing back in the day. Serious poker players (the pros) only played in casinos and in sponsored tournaments. But some guy in 2003 named Chris Moneymaker qualified for a huge tournament from online poker, and won the tournament. Every year the World Series of Poker (WSOP) has a main event tournament for each style of poker (with Texas Hold'em being the most popular) with first place prizes of several million. And this guy in 2003 qualified from his home online, and won several million. This started a crazy poker revolution, since now every Internet player can think like "if I'm just good enough online, I can win money, and I can beat the poker pros." So online poker has become a huge community, and that's how I got started. 

I played some poker as a kid online using free software. It was just a fun game to play, but I could never get anywhere since I was underage, and I didn't have any way to pay. Generally, there are two types of poker games. There's a tournament style where everyone who plays in the tournament pays an entrance fee, and some number of top finishers get some percentage of the total fees paid. There's also a cash style, where you pay some amount of cash, and that's how much money you have in that game, and you play other people who paid some amount, to try and win their money while they win yours. Since it's still gambling, there's still an element of "shit I don't want to lose all my money", so you have to set limits on yourself and how much you want to spend on the game. So you have to decide "I'm going to spend $1000 on this game AND THAT'S ALL I'M COMFORTABLE WITH", and if you lose all of that you need to scale back down to maybe $100 instead of $1000, and so on, until you make up the money you lost. That's what makes poker so awesome.

Poker is awesome because of how *logical* and *straightforward* it is.

The whole premises of poker is probabilities. If you can do probabilities perfectly, like a robot can, you are *guaranteed* over time, to win more money than you lose. It's hard to explain perfectly, but because there are 52 cards in a deck, you have 2 cards, your opponents each have 2 cards, and there are 5 cards on the table possibly, there's a finite number of hands that could be possible. Because it's finite, based on the cards on the table and what you **think** your opponent has, you can give a probability about what chance you have to win. And if you only put in the correct percentage of money, then over time you will do well, because generally no one puts in the perfect percentage of money all the time, and if you can do it more than other people do, then you should win. It's actually a really logical and "by the steps" approach to the game and making money, and that's why it's so fascinating and cool to me especially now since programming and math generally promotes the same ideas &ndash; embrace logic and reasoning.

So I've started playing a lot more poker, mainly live because it's illegal to gamble online in the USA, and I haven't found many places to play in Canada, where I do play online. 

As I'm getting more experience, I'm starting to notice a strange phenomenon. Playing poker well is about being very logical in your decision making and choices. There's a well documented problem called **tilt** that happens when you become emotional and stray from that perfect logic. Usually that happens when you lose a lot even though you thought you should've won. But I've noticed it happening to me when I start winning. 

I'm not a bad player (I hope), so sometimes I end up winning by quite a lot (a bit of luck sprinkled in). But since this is the first time I've been playing real games for a lot of money ($50-100 buy-in fee to play), sometimes I'm up by quite a bit, and I suddenly feel bad. When I have good hands, I bluff by pretending to have a bad hand, which means I can win more money if they think they can beat my hand (which they can't). And then I win a lot of money. 

But later on, I start feeling bad about it. It's stupid to feel bad about it because it's part of the game and that's how it works, but I do anyways. And it messes up my game. I'll play stupid hands, make stupid bets and kind of like try to give them the money back by being stupid. It's actually really annoying.

I have this overwhelming need to please everyone I know so it really bugs me when I find out that someone doesn't like me. So doing something like taking money from someone by tricking them doesn't really sit well with me. Or that's what I think is going on. I really want to play poker, and play poker well, but if this happens everytime I do well, it won't go well... It's a weird place to be at honestly, but I'm sure I can get over the weirdness. Just a fun problem I've been seeing.
