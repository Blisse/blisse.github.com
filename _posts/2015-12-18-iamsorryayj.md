Something is wrong.

I hate that one person can have so much control over my life. Something even as small as a change in the tone of our conversations makes me really anxious. It's really annoying. But I can't really blame them for their actions, if this is the type of person I am. I don't think I would like it either. It's needy and unflattering. And even worse, I feel like this has happened before, and I'm starting to see a pattern. This is something that needs to change.

I want to say that it happens because I stop moving. I'm only just beginning to love finding new hobbies and new things to do, and getting better at the hobby and meeting new people, just trying out new things. But it seems like somewhere along the way, life starts being routine. I do the same things over and over again, and instead of being fun and exciting, it becomes tiring and stale.

In some ways it makes sense. I've always been very reserved. My life has always been predictable and straight forward. I've always liked order and planning and preparation and being careful. And it's gone relatively well so far. But I think I'm boring. I'm too obvious. I'm too risk aware and risk averse and care too much about what people think. I don't like taking chances.

My friends in high school would often say that I'm like a robot. I'm not sure if that was complimentary, or if it was super deep inspection of my life. I am a robot though. I try to be straightforward and clear with my opinions.

I'm not sure what's wrong.

It could be any one of a thousand things. It might be just the way life is, like fate. I hate that word. I hate that I don't have control over the world. But I understand that all I have control of is myself, and how I perceive and influence the environment around me. So I can take action.

This is my action then.

Be more spontaneous. Be more random. Take more chances. Jump onto opportunities. Have more adventures.

I don't know how this will end up. But maybe that's the point.

My first change is this Christmas. Instead of being at home over the holidays, I'll be going to Nepal for a 5 day trek and some more craziness. I'm going to take a look into photography, because I've always been told I suck (and I do). I'm going to be more impulsive, instead of researching day in and out before making any decisions.

Something is wrong, and something needs to change. So let's go for it.
