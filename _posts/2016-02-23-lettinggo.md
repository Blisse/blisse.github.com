The hardest thing in life is letting go.

Totally not ripped from [this Coldplay song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAGbq3A9HfA).

And totally not related to the infamous song, Let It Go.

There are two ways you grow in life. 

1. Accepting new ideas
2. Letting go of old ideas

Everything you do centers around these two concepts.

Learning is fun. 

I have never met a single person who doesn't like learning. Whether you're sitting in a classroom, out with friends, on the web alone, your appetite for learning never ends. Our appetite to find information and our ability to absorb information is never-ending. We flirt with new ideas and new beliefs all the time, and we are always surprised in how much delight we can get learning something new.

If you've ever expanded your horizons, found a new hobby you've loved, explored a new path, read a new book, learned a new technique, you know how much learning new ideas fills your life with energy.

> When you are learning about the world, you are accepting.
> When you are learning about yourself, you are letting go. 

We can always handle information coming in, until it conflicts with who we are.

As we go through life, our mind constructs an image of who we are. *I am an artist. I am an engineer. I am a programmer. I am atheist. I believe in God. I am good at math. I am good at writing. I am a reliable friend. I am a good person. I am smart. I am stupid.* We use this image to ground ourselves in the world. This is the world, and here is my take on it. We use this image to form our core beliefs in the world, and in ourselves.

As time passes, we inevitably find out that some of our beliefs are wrong.

> What we do when our beliefs are challenged is what drives us to grow stronger and stronger.

Some of us grew up hating vegetables. Spinach was unbearable as children, and we could never imagine liking it. But one day we eat out with friends, try a new dish, and realize that spinach isn't so bad. Broccoli isn't awful. Greens can actually taste good. Our identity hating vegetables was challenged and let go, just by the passage of time and the irreversible truth that spinach tasted good.

Those are weakly-held beliefs. What about beliefs in our personality? What if we grew up thinking that we were right all the time? We always did well, and we always worked hard and got what we wanted. We thought that the world worked one way, and that would always work that way. A lot of students feel that way, and then completely lose it in university when their world expands and the their reality of the world is no longer true. We don't do well all the time anymore, we work hard and still fail. We come face to face with this dissonance in our lives, and the gravity of it completely blows us away. 

A State Attorney General was responsible for setting up the Japanese internment camps in World War II. When the war ended, he realized his mistake, and reversed his stance completely, becoming one of the most progressive justice in Supreme Court history, [Earl Warren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Warren#Japanese-American_internment).

I went through high school oblivious to life. I thought things would fall on my lap. I thought I didn't need people in my life. I went to university, and I fell in love with a girl. I thought we would spend our lives together. I built my reality around our lives together. We broke up. My reality shattered. I broke for a while. ... One day, I let go of that reality. 

* I let go of the idea that we were meant to be together. 
* I let go of the idea that I would do well forever. 
* I let go of the idea that all it took was hard work to do well. 
* I let go of the idea that I didn't like spinach, broccoli, olives.

* I started to fall for another girl. She said no. I had to let go of that reality as well. 
* I thought that going to the gym was for freaks. I let go of that idea. 
* I believed that I would never find happiness again. I let go of that, and now I can smile again. 
* I knew that my path in the world would be clear once I reached my goal (to work at Microsoft). I was wrong. I let go of that. 

I am honestly more confused than I ever was, but overcoming these fake realities has been so rewarding. 

Today, I know that every belief I have about myself and the world means nothing. I know that any of them can change at any moment, and I actively fight to figure out and overcome all the friction I encounter with my beliefs and the world. 

Who knows, maybe tomorrow I'll learn that this is wrong too. 

For now though, don't let your own reality hold you back.
