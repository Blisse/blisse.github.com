I can't sleep.

..

I don't know what I want in life.

It seems like I'm always making the wrong decisions. Going after the wrong goals. Chasing after the wrong people. Taking the wrong risks. Building the wrong dreams. Finding happiness in the wrong places. 

Soul-searching, but never mending my own soul.

It makes me afraid of life. 

It makes me afraid when the strength of my achievements never seems to overcome the crushing weight of my failures.

It makes me sit here at 4AM every night wondering what I'm doing with my life. Why I'm chasing after a girl that doesn't want me. Why I'm chasing after dreams that were never mine. Why I'm lying to myself to keep my spirit up. Why I'm pretending to care about others just to not feel hopeless. Why I keep blogging about lies and failures in the hopes that someone will answer. Why I'm lying about my personality, my motivations, my skills to myself and to others. Why I'm always floating between happy and sad and lost and alive and empty.

What kind of person am I actually?

I just realized it's hilarious that this has come full circle.

According to some of my friends, I'm a very quotable person. I guess like being crazy with words and with gestures.

In Grade 9 Art, my friend asked me if I was going to take the business class next term. For some reason, my response was, "who am I?" Everyone thought it was hilarious. 

I was so certain of my path. "I'd learn about technology! Something with computers!" 

Well, I'm back to square one. "Who am I?"

I've had really amazing friends over the last several years. Some that have stuck by me even despite how awful I've treated them. Some that gave and gave and gave and gave and expected nothing in return. Some that believed in me when I never believed in myself. Some that push me up for nothing at all. 

Some that I will lose if I walk away from this life and career.

I managed to find friends that accept me for who I am and push me to go forward, together, to stay alive, together. Friends that try to understand me and inspire me to work harder, that I try my hardest to understand and give back. Friends as close to a family as I have ever been able to imagine.

Years rebuilding this life just to lose it all again if I walk away.

I don't spend enough time appreciating my friends. This is the best compliment I can hope to give. 

I never want to say goodbye to them.
