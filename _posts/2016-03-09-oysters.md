My ex-mentor at Microsoft is really cool. He invited me to go oyster hunting one weekend in Seattle. I really regret not going.

The world is ours to enjoy. We should really go for it.

Sometimes we have to take risks. We have no clue how the risks will turn out, but they'll turn out somewhere. We might not know the people or the places or the things, but we trust and we hope that it goes well. 

Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. And we try all over again.

We shouldn't let the failures cloud our judgment of the risks. And we shouldn't let our successes blind us from the pain of failures.

We should enjoy the world for what it is, and everything that it is. 

The world is ours to enjoy. Regardless of what happens. 

Enjoy every moment of it.
