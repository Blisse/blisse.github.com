  I don't know who said it, but it's true. If you want to get better, more often than not you'll have to do worse.
</p>

<p>
  The exact reason? People are bad. A pretty pessimistic view, but completely justified. Since our birth, we're are
  bombarded with a lot of information, especially so in this day and age. And it's our job to filter out what's good and
  what's bad. However, sometimes before we realize it, we'll have made this decision unconsciously. Perhaps you played a game for 
  a long time without a good strategy guide. Or perhaps you learned math one way instead of another. 
</p>

<p>
  Then you've used this 'bad style' for 5-10 years, and it's so ingrained into your being that you don't even think about why
  you do it this way and what other ways there are. When you realize you've been doing it wrong the entire time, it takes a 
  tremendous amount of effort to break your old habits and rewire that muscle memory. 
</p>

<p>
  So when you are able to see directly where you want to go <b>right</b> from the beginning, and visualize the route you're going to take, and
  actually have that happening to you, it gives you a huge advantage over others. At least, it gave me a big advantage.
</p>

<p>
  It's not to say people were playing <span class="italics">wrong</span>. If we didn't have the advantage of the Internet, and all its
  information, what normal people would have been doing so far just seems right. But innovators don't think like that. They kept their eyes open. 
  They noticed the implications, the limits and weaknesses of each style, and kept questioning all their decisions. Certainly a revolutionary 
  and enviable way of thinking. 
</p>

<p>
  The new generation only play in a one-line style. And some get really good with it. But they've been tunnel-visioned into this style.
  They're not open to new ideas, and they don't have the experience of swapping styles and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.
  At low to mid-levels of Tetris, combo-ing is the most effective way to play, yet most players don't realize this because they only play
  their one-line style. For fun, that's fine. To get good? We'll need something else.
</p>

  These are examples of the styles. The standard Tetris grid is 10x20(+2), 10 horizontal. 
</p>

<p>
  To the left, with the one-line style, one space is left empty and you
  build upwards from there. In two-line, two spaces are left empty, and so on. The two-line style is the easiest to play, and easily beats the one-line 
  if you play at the same level. Why? Like I said, combo-ing is the best way to begin, and the two-line is almost a guaranteed combo chain everytime you start.
  Why? Well if you took the time to think about it a bit, it'd make perfect sense. Every single Tetris piece except the I-piece will continue a combo
  if you drop it in the 2-block wide hole because every block except the I-piece has a width of 2 somewhere.
</p>

<p>
  The next thing you'll notice is then how high combos are devastating, so you'll want as high a combo as possible. To get that, you'll find it's best to only clear
  one line when you're combo-ing. Done well enough, you can possibly have a 13-14 consecutive combo, which is very, very strong. But to get that, you have to 
  realize that two-line isn't the only style to play. That's very easy when you have already realized that one-line isn't the only style to play and then 
  moved on to two-line. But think about all the one-line players who haven't realized this. You have to question yourself at every turn.
</p>

<p>
  Playing well doesn't mean you'll perform well however. A large component of improving in Tetris is consistency. There is almost zero room for mistakes.
  And if you do make a mistake, you need to have the foresight to minimize its effects, and fix it, because it is very costly to the consecutive combo-ing if you
  aren't careful. Multiple mistakes, and you can probably forfeit the game already if you're playing at very high levels. Consistency requires stamina, of course, 
  and you'll notice as you play more, your performance will degrade at times. It's important to take frequent breaks, and eventually you'll notice you can play for 2 hours 
  without severe performance degradation. 
</p>

<p>
  Consistency throughout multiple games is important, but also consistency throughout every single game. Play the beginning exactly like how you would play out the
  ending. Calmly and quickly. If you play the entire match at <span class="italics">your</span> pace, you won't lose simply because you messed up once. Every portion of 
  your game will be dangerous. I have been down 2 or 3 KOs multiple times right at the start of the game, but I pace myself. I can came back and win,
  simply because I'm playing this strong, fast pace where I don't make mistakes, yet not sacrifice attacking potential. The pace I set for myself is supremely comfortable
  because it's the only pace I play at. I don't alternate at random between conservative and aggressive. I don't let my playstyle dictate my pace, as one-line players must do.
  I don't feel panicked down 0-3 as much as I should because I know if I simply play the style properly, I can come back. Being comfortable is very important.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually you can reach a point where building up your stack is almost done by reflex, and you will notice you have a lot more freedom and time to stare at your 
  opponent's game and <span class="italics">predict</span> what he'll do, and then play your own side in anticipation. This is a very strong strategy, 
  and combined with a strong foundation will improve your game dramatically.. And because you have such a strong core already, adding things like 
  prediction or ending strongly or beginning combos will have much more visible effects.
