   <title type="html">how tetris battle works - the style</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/20/howtetrisworks"/>
   <updated>2012-08-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/20/howtetrisworks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  To get better, you must get worse. That's very true if you've started off in a bad style, and need to move to another one. 
  No one is immediately amazing at every new thing they try, so don't be discouraged. You must also keep an open mind to your style
  so that you can recognize the implications of playing how you play. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  I'll point out the most common idea that should come up. Last part, I mentioned that people only know one way to play. People in that mindset
  don't want to get out of it because &quot;it's hard,&quot; or &quot;I don't like the way it feels.&quot; Thus they allow themselves to settle for a sub-standard style.
  Fine for casual gaming, not fine for improvement. Often, they don't realize the simple fact that comboing consecutively is a lot better than
  a Tetris or back-to-back Tetris. That's a realization most players make when they transition out of it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Only from that point do you realize that if you can maximize the effectiveness of each piece during a combo, you'll fare much better off. 
  And that's how you realize what's possible moving forward. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  The 2-line style is the best style to improve, I think. Playing this well will get you from 10-60 easily. The beauty lies in the 2 block empty spaces.
  When you throw your pieces in there, every piece is guaranteed to make at least one line, bar the I-piece. This means 7 combos are now available at the minimum,
  and when you play more, even 13 combos are a possibility when you add in bomb clearing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  In Tetris, you definitely do not want to make mistakes. A single mistake can throw off your game. Two mistakes in a row 
  will crush you when you're at higher levels. So it's a good idea to start learning proper technique. Lots of players focus on speed
  and speed alone. When they get near to the end of the match, all of that goes to hell. Concentration breaks and mistakes happen.
  What potentially could've been another 10-20 lines sent all ends because they made one mistake that may have cost them the break.
  What's the most important rule then? Pacing. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  You need to play at a consistently good pace the entire game. That way, your entire game stabilizes, and you won't lose simply because
  you messed up once. I've been in many situations where my opponent gets 2 points ahead because they anticipated my moves, but then they can't 
  keep up a solid style and I end up winning 3-2, simply because I'm playing to not make mistakes, not for attacking opportunities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Once you reach a level where you can build up carelessly, then you can take quick peeks at your opponent's stack, and with that stack, peek at their
  incoming pieces. This is when those other pillars start to join in. You want to develop your core game, then add these little boosts. And because you 
  have such a strong core, it's super easy to incorporate it, and you'll reap the benefits much better.

   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/19/whattetrisdoesright"/>
   <updated>2012-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/19/whattetrisdoesright</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I recently got to level 95 in Tetris Friends Battle 2P and 6P, so here's some Tetris.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris'&gt;Tetris&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat of a famous game. Most people who've played it probably first
  started on the GameBoy. Maybe something like this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='centered'&gt;
&lt;img alt='ye olde Tetris' src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/GB_Tetris.png' /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Nowadays, &lt;a href='http://www.tetrisfriends.com/' target='_blank'&gt;Tetris Friends&lt;/a&gt; is all the rage. 
  And for good reason.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  They sort of have a monopoly on the casual Tetris scene, being the exclusive licensee of Tetris in North America and Europe. They have a dedicated site and an app on Facebook. 
  And actually, it probably wouldn't be very wrong to say that Tetris Friends is the reason Tetris has experienced a recent resurgence.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  The Tetris Friends has several game modes in both Single Player and Multiplayer. Marathon, where you try to clear as many lines as possible,
  to Sprint 5P, where you play 3 others to finish 40 lines in the fastest time, to Battle 2P, where you battle another player and score KOs. 
  It's really addicting, very smooth, and just very fun to play. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  My main experience is with the Multiplayer Battle 2P and 6P modes, so that's where my point of view will be from.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class='subheader'&gt;History&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  In May, one of my high school friends saw me playing Tetris, and asked me for a match. I hadn't seen him in a while, so why not.
  In short, he crushed me. Long version? He REALLY crushed me. I actually thought I was decent. He was Level 100, literally a Tetris God (more on that later).
  I vowed that day to get to a point where I could compete toe-to-toe with him. At least, somewhere toe-to-toe. It was a game, and it was a 
  fun challenge. My favourite kind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Over the last 3 months, I played Tetris Friends pretty religiously. After work, a couple hours. On the weekends, a couple hours. Nothing too crazy,
  but it got me really into the game, and to a point where I could see a vast improvement over my nooby self from May. It was very rewarding to realize
  that putting this effort and determination into something actually paid off. Yay!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Battle 2P is the most competitive game mode. You play another player from around the world,
  send as many lines as possible to the other player, and hope you KO them more than they do to you. To send lines, you'll have to perform combos, either 
  consecutively or with a T-spin. Along the way, you'll also have to clear the lines that your opponent sends to you by clearing the bombs away. It's complicated,
  but play a few times and you'll get the gist of it. Here's a image I found off Google.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class='centered'&gt;
&lt;img alt='Tetris Battle' class='scale-with-grid child-padding' src='http://i.ytimg.com/vi/AHdBNRff2AY/0.jpg' /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
  Starting off, I was pretty bad, but I knew how to improve, and I set about playing only for that purpose.
  Knowing how to improve is really important. There's a lot of players that are really amazing at some parts of the game, but say, play a bad style, and that hinders
  their improvement. There isn't really an exact skill ceiling for this game since you can play at blistering speeds. But having a bad strategy will harm your development
  in the long run.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Most players in the game know of only one way to play. I will refer to this as the 1-line style. Since the game board is 10 spaces across, they'll fill up
  9 of those spaces as high as possible, leaving 1 space at the left or right side, while saving up the I-piece, then drop it once for 
  a Tetris, and again for a Back-to-Back Tetris. This is pretty good for low levels, and solid enough to help develop your building skills. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
  But definitely, it's the worst way to play.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class='subheader'&gt;Pillars&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Before I move on, I want to focus on some essential &quot;pillars&quot; of playing Battle Tetris. Essentially, a Battle Tetris game consists of these steps.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

- Opening &lt;br /&gt;
- Build-up &lt;br /&gt;
- Combos &lt;br /&gt;
- Anticipation &lt;br /&gt;
- Bomb Clearing &lt;br /&gt;
- Ending &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

  Well, that's a lot of new stuff. Let's just take a look at the important ones then.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Please disregard the opening (how to start the game), the anticipation (predicting and counter-attacking your opponent),
  bomb clearing (getting rid of the lines your opponent sent you), and the ending (how to end the game well). They're really more advanced skills,
  and having solid mechanics in the build-up and combos will definitely be more useful to begin your gaming.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  The benefit of having a solid foundation is that you start to become consistent, which is a huge part of Tetris Friends. Suppose you can type at 160wpm if it's your favourite passage.
  Other times, you'll type at 60wpm because it's not. Well, suddenly that isn't that useful. However, if you develop a strong foundation to begin with, while your maximum isn't going to
  increase dramatically, you'll pick up your minimum, and slowly move up. That's why we focus on mechanics first, and that can only be built by playing lots of fundamentally correct games.

   <title type="html">some cables feel really nice</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/11/reallynicecables"/>
   <updated>2012-08-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/11/reallynicecables</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I recently gained possession of a really nice pair of cables. 1/4&quot; male to 1/4&quot; male. Nothing 
  special really, except the cable feels really nice.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
  I have a pair of &lt;a href='http://www.moon-audio.com/audio-cables/moon-audio-headphone-cables/moon-audio-blue-dragon-headphone-cable.html'&gt;Blue Dragon&lt;/a&gt; cables from Moon-Audio. Apparently it's surrounded by Kevlar
  and Teflon tape. Yum. That link isn't the same pair, but it's close. It feels like a really high quality 
  braided cable. All newer Razer peripherals come braided with a &lt;a href='http://cdn.theendearingdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Razer-Naga-Gaming-Mouse-Review14.jpg'&gt;cloth like material&lt;/a&gt;. 
  It feels nice, but the Blue Dragon cable is less flexible, with a really strong and plasticky feel. 
  It feels amazing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  My new cable feels even better. It's completely rubberized, which isn't something I've seen a lot.
  The rubber is really textured, unlike the smooth plasticky rubber on a lot of cables. It's 
  made by Fender, and says Professional Noiseless Cable on the cable itself. I don't know why that message is required. 
  Isn't that expected of every cable? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Oh well. It feels so nice I don't mind.

   <title type="html">Tools - Dexpot</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/03/toolsdexpot"/>
   <updated>2012-08-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/03/toolsdexpot</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  When I first used Ubuntu, I fell in love with graphical 
  &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workspace#Graphical_interfaces' target='_blank'&gt;workspaces&lt;/a&gt;.
  The ability to open and manage multiple desktops was a great implementation when you only have one monitor. 
  The controls were intuitive, the  transitions were clean and delays were non-existent. 
  It was an amazing discovery.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  I later found out that Apple's OS X has the Expose and Spaces for their own version of workspaces. 
  It is noticeably faster, more responsive and applied better features, as expected on the very well 
  designed Mac OS. As a Windows user primarily however, I felt very left out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  After a lot of searching, I found the solution. &lt;a href='http://dexpot.de/' target='_blank'&gt;Dexpot&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  They've made a lot of improvements since I've first time I used it, and right now, it's evolved into something
  beautiful. They've added much better taskbar integration, a less buggy multi-monitor support, and much, much better 
  responsiveness overall. It's a great product with a great team behind it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Simply put, virtual desktops allow one to swap between screens. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  The main benefit is clutter. Spacing out several applications over four screens is great, similar to the benefits
  of using multiple monitors. It means you can categorize your workspaces, one section for reference applications, 
  one side for working programs, and another area for anything else.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Keeping the programs maximized like this means the program is almost always active. Minimizing and maximizing is 
  a drag, while with Dexpot or any virtual desktop application, pressing a customized key combination, say ALT+1 or 
  ALT+2, will swap the active applications to a new set. It's much more convenient.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  The difference in productivity is pretty astounding. Give it a go &lt;a href='http://dexpot.de/?id=download' target='_blank'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;a href='http://www.dropbox.com' target='_blank'&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; is amazing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Because I use some slightly more complicated system with GitHub and Dropbox, 
  I had to learn some new stuff so that I could upload my website properly to GitHub Pages.
  The first time I tried it, I actually deleted my website files, along with the 
  GitHub repository. I had nothing to roll back to. It was all gone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  But to my joy, I always debated whether to put the website source in my Dropbox, so I could
  work on it and sync my files across my computers. So I left it on my Dropbox this time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  When I accidentally deleted my website files, I found out that Dropbox saves a history of your deleted
  files, so that you can recover them if they go accidentally, and actually use them as a mini-version
  tracker. Awesome for a free service.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Thank you very much Dropbox, for saving a couple days' or weeks' worth of material. Thank you.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  When people ask for motivation, it's really hard to give them a straight answer. 
  I never had one myself. But recently, I've had some really bad problems that 
  left me scratching my head. I couldn't solve it, and there was nothing I could do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  But then I came along a couple of really good motivational posts, which really,
  in essence, told me to do it because failure is not an option. Mediocrity is not an option.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  And that's what I've always believed in. My motivation was always really, 
  &quot;Do it because you can. Do it to prove to yourself that you can. 
  Do it 100% because when it's all over, you're still an insignificant speck,
  unless your 100% is better than his.&quot; Talk about an inferiority complex going on here.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  But I realized, I grew into a habit of accepting mediocrity. It might be because the university 
  system forces this down our throats a bunch, and some life-changing realizations I've made since. 
  I shouldn't be making excuses for my failures, because there isn't time in life to do this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  
&lt;div class='highlight'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='console'&gt;&lt;span class='go'&gt;60sec * 60min * 24hr * 365.25days * 100 yrs = 3,155,760,000 seconds. Not enough.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  I can't let one little thing set me back so much of that time. Just as much as I can't do something
  50%, and then complain about it later on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Screw getting the motivation. I'll just do it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href='http://youtu.be/Sk56VxaeqEQ' target='_blank'&gt;The BEST Motivation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &quot;You need to ask yourself, 'what are you going to do today,' &lt;br /&gt;
  but more importantly, 'how are you going to do it.'&quot;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Sometimes, the oddest of circumstances makes you remember things you did in 
  the past, that somehow you forgot over the years. And most of the time, it puts a 
  really big smile on your face when you remember.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
  I was having an innocent argument with an artist about stuff that we've made in the 
  past. While my friend is clearly the better artist between the two of us, I remembered
  that I really wanted to be a (graphic) artist at some point in my life. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  My Grade 9 Art mark was an astounding 100, a surprise, even to myself. I think my 
  Art teacher had a lot of hope in me, and was probably a little heartbroken when me 
  and my friend (who also got 100), decided not to take Grade 10 Art.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Since Grade 5 or 6, I have always been the biggest Counter-Strike fan, until some 
  tragic event a couple of years ago that forced me to quit. I played a lot of Counter-Strike, 
  so I'm pretty sure my 662 HOURS PLAYED on Steam is inaccurate. In my spare time then, 
  I thought about Counter-Strike a lot. But that's for another time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  One day, I stumbled upon a thriving online game modding community in 
  &lt;a href='http://www.fpsbanana.com' target='_blank'&gt;FPSBanana&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately I was hooked. 
  The most memorable member was &lt;a href='http://gamebanana.com/members/164481' target='_blank'&gt;Teh Snake&lt;/a&gt;.
  He made so many brilliant and amazing mods, he really was the reason I wanted to go into graphic design.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Eventually, I tried my hand at modding, and upon realizing I had no talent,
  I tried something much, much easier, and something that brings me joy to see online to this very day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  I made a custom hand skin for CS1.6 and CZ after collaborating with the original owner, Nasaratsu.
  Here's the &lt;a href='http://gamebanana.com/cscz/skins/48319' target='_blank'&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, and while it's 
  really bad, I'm still extremely proud of it. Over 6,000 downloads, and 14,000 views. :')

   <title type="html">first coding interview</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/04/14/failinterview"/>
   <updated>2012-04-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/04/14/failinterview</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I had an interview the other day that really shook me up.

He asked me a question that really made me wonder how much I really knew about programming. 
I really thought I knew Python (at least somewhat decently), but I understand now there's a difference between using a language a few times, and actually knowing the language in and out.

My answer was... &quot;crap.&quot; I did not know what to do really, and it cost me the interview. I was ashamed, and now that I try it, I should've known it. 

The question was (I think): 


&lt;div class='highlight'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='console'&gt;&lt;span class='go'&gt;Remove the first letter from each word in the string: &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='gp'&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='s2'&gt;&amp;quot;asdf das f po&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 
EDIT(2012-07-16): This was my March attempt.


&lt;div class='highlight'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='python'&gt;&lt;span class='c'&gt;# removes spaces from string&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class='n'&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='o'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='n'&gt;original&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class='k'&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='n'&gt;newline&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



EDIT(2012-07-16): How did I not realize how bad this was back when I wrote it? 
Wow. Just wow. I don't know how I made it this far programming if that was the best I could 
come up with. Honest.


&lt;div class='highlight'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='python'&gt;&lt;span class='k'&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='nf'&gt;removefirstletter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='n'&gt;sentence&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='p'&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class='n'&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='o'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='n'&gt;sentence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='o'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class='k'&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='n'&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ow'&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='nb'&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='nb'&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class='n'&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='o'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='s'&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='o'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='nb'&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;])[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='mi'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;:])&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class='k'&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='s'&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='o'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


Easily handles any issue with spacing when you remove the word with one letter.

The output should be 


&lt;div class='highlight'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='console'&gt;&lt;span class='gp'&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='s2'&gt;&amp;quot;df as o&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


I'd like to think I made progress, but this could be done a lot better still. 
But if I got this far in 3 months, I'm can't think of the possibilities in a couple years!

This is my first post. So, an obligatory


&lt;div class='highlight'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='python'&gt;&lt;span class='k'&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='nf'&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class='k'&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='s'&gt;&amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class='k'&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='n'&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='o'&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='s'&gt;&amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class='n'&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
