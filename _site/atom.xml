   <title type="html">a clockwork wtf</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/12/05/aclockworkwtf"/>
   <updated>2012-12-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/12/05/aclockworkwtf</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;sixteen columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There's a huge difference between reading something for fun and reading something for study.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At least for study, your thoughts are focused in the direction of the teachers' musings. They provide subtle hints that you can clue in on about the message that the story is conveying. They help you try and divulge meaning from the text, rather than read it as you would a movie.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So I'm not sure why I decided to read it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      You always hear it being heralded as a literary triumph; a classic, timeless masterpiece. It's tempting, especially when the current generation of books is so pathetic. I'm not talking about Twilight, since it's clearly not vying for any real literary awards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I'm talking about Life of Pi somehow expressing more than just a really good story. And I'm seriously disinterested in those middle Eastern civil war novels like The Kite Runner and anything of a similar style.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Maybe the current generation of award winning novels are different. I haven't followed the literary scene at all for a long time, but reading classics like Catch 22 feels a lot more thought provoking than my usual fantasy novels, though each have their place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So I do understand something is happening in the clockwork. I want to say I can easily follow the narrative, but really the language is a painful mess to drudge through, and it's extremely difficult to put down the novel and pick it up later, in both that the novel is engaging and difficult to get yourself into the flow of the story.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Forcing readers to relearn the new dialect completely is a really smart way to force reader engagement. It makes you focus on the content and consider each line carefully, while adding a sort of realism and disconnect to this imaginary society.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I don't want to comment on the actual story because it's something that should really be experienced individually, and my interpretations may be a bit off. However, the kind of mental-fucked-up-ness that it shows is slightly cool in its own sense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I mean, you can sort of see how the world could turn to shit like that, mainly because the entire lens that the reader experiences is so twisted; the protagonist's actions, the writing style, all contribute to this sort of distorted atmosphere that makes the entire story feel so realistic, but so disconnected at the same time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And the end of the novel, because I'm not constantly reflecting and writing paragraphs about what I thought about each section, I'm kind of in shock about what I've just read. It's also slightly hard to process each event without the weird writing style bleeding through my thoughts. It's a literal literary mindfuck, though it stands out so strongly in its own distinct mindfucked way that I'm not sure if it was really saying what I thought it was saying.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The book definitely feels like a real story. Everything in the novel achieves a strong sense of circular conclusiveness like you would want in a good story. While not to say loose ends are all closed, the style and narrative really complements each other well in a way I haven't experienced or felt before.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It's a great read, for sure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title type="html">depression</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/11/23/depression"/>
   <updated>2012-11-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/11/23/depression</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;sixteen columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What constitutes depression?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Over several months, I lost everything.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a massive snowball downwards. Nothing made sense anymore. Time blurred by, it's already been 3 months and back to work. Grades dropped; I have no chance to make back into the top 10% of the class. Exercise dropped; it's cold, and it's too physically and mentally draining against my schoolwork. Motivation dropped; I just don't see a point. Reflection increased. Interactions with people dropped. Loneliness increased. Hundredfold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      What do you look forward to when you're depressed? What do you see in your future that makes you cling on to hope?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      In short, nothing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      It was never a constant in my mind. I did not spend days and weeks brooding over my existence, staring at the void. I'm not like that. I love the disconnect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      My life is centered around the disconnect. That feeling of immersing yourself into your computer. Forgetting about all your worries, about all your concerns. Focusing simply on your digital self; guiding your character throughout a game, finishing up on coding projects, losing myself in a sea of videos. An easy way to spend days, months; an escape from reality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When you leave the disconnect, suddenly, you're bombarded with all the crap you have been avoiding. The homework assignments you don't know how to do. The classes you're doing poorly in. The lack of friends you have. The breakdown of your social skills. The empty void in your life left by your ex. The belief that you might never find someone that you can interact with like you did with your ex.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      That's how far the down-swings go. The up-swings? Nearly non-existent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Sometimes, when I'm walking home at night, I will stare up at the sky, and forget about everything. There's something about the stars that just makes you feel small, that makes your problems feel small, and that melts away all your worries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Or maybe you will look at the morning sky and it'll seem so peaceful that your mind eases up. You can finally smile a bit. You can hum a tune in your head and seem to bob along, because your worries disappeared. But that feeling disappears as fast as it came.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      In fact, I think the real effect of depression is really how little good things actually affect you. Someone will be exceptionally nice to you for no reason and you feel good, but in an hour, it's like it never happened. You can exist in some ethereal happiness, but after a couple minutes, you forget why you were happy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I'm not better yet. Not by a long shot. But I'll get there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I have goals. I have dreams. And none of those involve lying down and simply dying. I have so many things to work for, that I just can't roll over. Not now, not ever.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Yet everything still seems futile. I am the result of the individual experiences that made up my existence. I am the result of everything I have learned, everything that I have done, and everything that I will do. I have unique, and I really value my uniqueness. I have tried so hard to accept my own uniqueness. I realize that really, I am who I am. I try my best with what hand I'm given, and everything I do has a reason and a purpose. But it never seems like it's enough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I continually validate my existence and push myself harder, but nothing ever turns out the way I want it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      And even worse, that feeling of understanding, acceptance and satisfaction never lasts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      But I can do this. Really. I'm no longer scared of asking for help, because I have nothing to lose anymore. Being too shy to ask some people, and being unable to communicate well is a different story. I post a bit to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teamliquid.net/blogs/viewblog.php?topic_id=383710&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; I frequent, and they give me so much advice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      It really pains me not to be able to accept everyone's advice at once and simply move on, but everything worth fighting for takes time. And at this moment, I'm fighting for my life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      People say, it's just a phase. I say, it's going to be a phase. And I have to overcome all the hardships that this phase entails.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I'm already trying out so much to fix myself, and I'm afraid I'm going to fail. But when I do fail, you can bet I will pick myself back up again. If not in an hour, then in a day, or in a week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      This is not so much a blog as a personal declaration. I will make it through this. I will.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title type="html">you are bad. deal with it</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/11/13/youarebadsodealwithit"/>
   <updated>2012-11-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/11/13/youarebadsodealwithit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;sixteen columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I don't know where this came from, but most of the time, it's true.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      You have to get worse before you get better.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      That applies for almost everything that's worth fighting for. If all we experienced was happiness, we would never appreciate the true extent of happiness because we do not have the perspective of the other side.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Understanding and accepting this helps a lot in self-improvement. When you are down, you realize that everyone else has been down before, and it has always turned out alright. When you can't do it, you realize that if you do finally do it, the feeling of success will be beyond description.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Accepting that you're bad goes a long way in improving yourself to not be as bad. It's like every sport. Sooner or later, you realize that you're only good at the district level, and that there's thousands of people at the provincial level, and tens of thousands in the national level and international levels that would stomp on you any day, and that's not including all the people who play very well, but not competitively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      So once you hit that road block, you can either sit down and accept your fate, or push yourself forward, for a little more pain. Because that's what it takes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The thing that gets most people is motivation. What's the point of doing better? Shouldn't I worry about X instead? (where X is making friends, having fun, etc)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Well, yes, you should worry about all of those; if you don't want to improve. You may say that this activity is entirely superficial. I have this goal that I want to work towards with this activity, that is directly contradictory to improvement. Then, yes, go for it. But why would you? How is improvement ever detrimental? How is making yourself stronger, faster, more prepared, more athletic, more nimble, more concentrated, more anything ever detrimental?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      Pain is temporary. Success is forever.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      In my eyes, I never see a reason I should be bad at something if I can do something about it. Why settle for anything that's less than perfect? Why live a life where you are just, mediocre. Why not aim as high as you can? When do you have anything to lose when you try your best at everything you do. Feel the pain, but reap the rewards.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      And I try not to make excuses about being bad either. If I screw up, then I screwed up. If I didn't work hard enough, then I didn't work hard enough. I lose because my opponent did everything better. And I know that I can definitely be at the same level as he or she, if I worked harder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      Life is hard work. Improvement is hard work. You are only limited by yourself.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      At least, that's the attitude I once had. Now I'm working my way back up there. And above.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      You are bad, so deal with it.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Accepting that you are bad means that you understand that your way of thinking is incorrect; sub-optimal. That means you have to accept new methods and form new habits over what you have been doing before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      It's a tough process. But I like to think that the tougher it is, the more that final goal is worth fighting for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2012-11-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/11/12/teamliquidattack</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
    Awesome! I was a bit busy with school work a couple weeks ago, but I managed to watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/TeamLiquid:_Attack!&quot;&gt;TeamLiquid Attack!&lt;/a&gt; episode with &lt;a href=&quot;http://white-ra.com/&quot;&gt;White-Ra&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    TeamLiquid Attack! is a Starcraft show where professional Starcraft gamers come play against community members as a sort of fan service. Guest casters, usually other community members, stream the matches to the community. If you want to play against them, you have to guess a trivia question they ask on the stream, or be really really lucky like I was.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/Mg19xi2vERA?t=33m49s&quot;&gt;Here I am&lt;/a&gt; in the final game, a 3v3 against iNcontroL, CatZ and White-Ra. I'm the Zerg player who kills the Probe. :D
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    I was actually too nervous during the entire game because I was freaking out since I never win anything and kind of starstruck. I think I was screaming like a fangirl the entire time. It was so awesome.

   <title type="html">CS241 MERL file linker</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/10/25/merllinker"/>
   <updated>2012-10-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/10/25/merllinker</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
    For an assignment in my CS241 class, we had to link two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/merl/merl.html&quot;&gt;MERL files&lt;/a&gt; by hand. I didn't want to do this, but I didn't understand the concept of linking MERL files well enough to program a linker to do it for me. I finished the assignment by hand, and after doing that, I could finally complete this linker I was working on. It was an interesting lesson to learn.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    I really enjoyed writing the linker, because it was fun to implement an algorithm to parse the input the output with classes, even though my solution is very primitive.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    I found out a slightly annoying limitation of Python that I must look for a solution around in the future. Apparently I can't directly read the MERL file directly, so my program's input has to be an xdd file, after running the UNIX xxd utility. Annoying, but I will live with it in the meantime.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;console&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;xxd -c 4 file1.merl &amp;gt; file1.xxd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;xxd -c 4 file2.merl &amp;gt; file2.xxd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;python linker.py file1.xxd file2.xxd output.txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    I put the code up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Blisse/MERL-Linker&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
    My university is decently funded, so across the campus, there are a lot of lab stations where groups of students can sit by a computer and work on
    their assignments, or for those without a computer at home, just surf the web freely. Everyday, the most popular lab areas are always nearly full. Students can bring their laptops and set up a little study area around one of the lab computers, or take a small island of tables and work in a group. It's really convenient.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    I sometimes visit these labs. I enjoy the environment and atmosphere. There's a quiet respect for everyone in the area, with a couple exceptions. Something I hate, but is necessary, is that they bolt the machines and monitors to the tables, so I can't hook the monitor to my laptop as a second screen, but it's not that much of a loss with workspaces and &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/archive/2012/08/03/index.html&quot;&gt;Dexpot&lt;/a&gt;. However, something else always bugged me when I was at the labs, and today I finally realized what it was.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;subheader&quot;&gt;
        Either the chairs are too low, or the tables are too high.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    I didn't think I would notice, but I did. Ergonomics are always a concern of mine. I actually thought I had developed RSI a couple years ago when my wrists ached constantly. It turned out my wrists were just digging into the edge of the table too much, but it did make me much more aware of how my desk positioned my body throughout the day.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    Well, I can safely say that the tables and chairs in the common lab room promote abhorrent posture. According to and not limited by all the following sources, your arm should form an angle greater than 90 degrees at the elbow, and the upper arm should be horizontal to the floor. Your legs should be flat on the floor, and your back to the chair.
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;subheader&quot;&gt;
        Guess how many sites recommend sitting in the position the E5 lab promotes? 
        &lt;br/&gt;...
        &lt;br/&gt;None.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
     That's it then. I guess I will have to see what rooms actually condone proper ergonomics. Along the way I might creep some people out, but some things must be sacrificed in the sake of the science. &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;*cough*&lt;/span&gt; I'll keep you posted after I scour UWaterloo for some good seats. 
&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/OBg92.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1..26 for a..z&quot; class=&quot;scale-with-grid&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  From the inspiration above, I decided to check out what words actually fit this definition. Sorry for the Comic Sans in the image, though.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  First, I'll define 
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;python&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;chars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;word_score&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;chars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Here's what that looks like in code.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;python&quot;&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;inspect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write_file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;output.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;current_file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;sumofletters.py&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exceptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;current_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;w&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;word_score_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ascii_lowercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;character&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Done!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Not as pretty as it could be, but it works fairly well. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pastebin.com/aySiHjUW&quot;&gt;Here's the result from my pastebin.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Ignoring non-ASCII characters, I get 5340 matches for words that total to 100. 
  'Inefficient' appears on there, so I have proven that first image is false with this contradiction.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Other interesting words that appear for word_score == 100 are:
    &lt;ul class=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;excellent&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snobbery&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;socialism&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;reengineer&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;practicing&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;defeminized&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  So, that looks like any image file, no? Actually, if you look at its source, it's really just a big line of text.
  I can't say I know too much about what's really behind it, but the line of text is a data URL, developed for the Data URI scheme (Uniform Resource Identifier scheme), which
  according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, was made specifically for 
  embedding images in a single file, rather than using conventional external images.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Reading a bit more, a uniform resource identifier is a string of characters that identifies a name or resource. 
  So a filepath will do, but also the Data URL, which breaks the resource data into a base64-encoded string.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://dataurl.net/#dataurlmaker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dataurl.net&lt;/a&gt;, you can convert most images to get a 
  Data URL, which you can then link to in your HTML file via

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;data:url&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  It's a pretty nifty little piece of code.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  In other news, the new site is up and running. I think it's a bit better than before.

   <updated>2012-09-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/09/15/gamingprofessionalism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I really like gaming. There is something beautiful about immersing yourself completely in the game.
  Losing yourself completely in this reality, and escaping the physical world. It is the same feeling I 
  try to get to when I'm listening to music. Bliss.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Lately, I've been following the emerging e-sports scene; gamers pushing towards making gaming a sport, 
  a thriving, sustainable industry with actual careers. The main game responsible? StarCraft.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  For the last 14 years, StarCraft and StarCraft:Brood War (I will refer to both as just BW), has been a huge 
  commercial success. But only in South Korea, where the best progamers compete in packed stadiums in front of
  screaming Korean fangirls, for huge grand prizes and honour, in two competitive proleagues, with top
  salaries in the 100K's. That's just, ridiculous to think about, but it's happened.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  But this success was not met across the globe. While the Korean community thrived, the Western community was much 
  more recluse. StarCraft wasn't as big; actually, Counter-Strike was the thing. But there were many strong contenders
  underground, who moved to Korea to train with the best. The Western scene was okay, but left much to be desired
  for the players.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  With the launch of StarCraft 2 (SC2), Blizzard, the developers, decided to take the huge success of BW and expand it across 
  the globe; the push for e-sports began. 2 years later, it's really obvious how much of an impact this has had. 
  Competitive gaming has become mainstream. Popularized by League of Legends, Defense of the Ancients 1 and 2, 
  Heroes of Newerth, Call of Duty, Halo, and StarCraft 2, gamers across the globe have ridiculously easier access to these games.
  It's easy to talk to a few friends about what's going on in the competitive scene, participate in some fantasy leagues, and even
  attend live events. 
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  So what's missing for the Western world? Taking a look at Korean BW, and European Counter-Strike, you can see
  something that's really surprising. Gamers, and the people around them, are surprisingly professional. Not only 
  in actions, but appearance. Most people still have the idea that gaming is only for 'nerds'. And currently, it's hard
  to disagree with them. While the competitive scenes have a fair share of exceptions, they are still the exception. 
  It is difficult for the mainstream society to enjoy watching a scrawny, freckled teenager with mismatched clothes win 
  several thousand dollars, as bad as that sounds. Western society has this huge emphasis on appearance that many gamers lack.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  However, it doesn't have to be that way. &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/VWOIgB37LKQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is SK|HeatoN, who was
  part of a very successful Counter-Strike team. And he looks and acts perfectly. If you watch Korean BW on television (yes, this exists),
  you'll see the commentators are exactly like that as well. Casual, yet professional. Same with the players, respectful and professional.
  Some of the players have even modeled. Image sells.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  While it's really enticing to have a thriving competitive scene where everyone is judgment-free and accepting of the geeky
  and nerdy tendencies of many gamers, it's important to the mainstream (and the sponsors) that there is some sort of 
  professional image put forth. There must be some agreement between all gamers that gaming can be your career, your life's work;
  if you take gaming seriously. If you treat video games like just a game, how are you going to convince someone it's also 
  a sport, and more importantly, how can you convince someone to make it a career? 
&lt;/p&gt;

  I'm working on my Poker game, and it's always the same story.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I always find that the hardest part is not the logic, but getting it playable. 
  I seem to always be torn between optimizing now so that I don't write horrible 
  code for future me to debug, and just getting it down. It's starting to get really annoying. 
  It's like some form of writer's block; for programmers. There's just so much I want to do
  and so little time to do it, I'm stuck deciding what to do instead of just going for it.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I think my best plan of attack is to just make it playable as soon 
  as possible. I don't think I should worry about optimizing now, even if it means 
  I'll have a harder job in the future. Hey, it'd be good experience to weed through really,
  really bad code.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;sixteen columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I don't know where this came from, but most of the time, it's true.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      You have to get worse before you get better.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      That applies for almost everything that's worth fighting for. If all we experienced was happiness, we would never appreciate the true extent of happiness because we do not have the perspective of the other side.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Understanding and accepting this helps a lot in self-improvement. When you are down, you realize that everyone else has been down before, and it has always turned out alright. When you can't do it, you realize that if you do finally do it, the feeling of success will be beyond description.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For Tetris at the very least, accepting that you're bad goes a long way in improving yourself to maybe not being as bad. It's like every sport. Sooner or later, you realize that you're only good at the district level, and that there's thousands of people at the provincial level, and tens of thousands in the national level and international levels that would stomp on you any day, and that's not including all the people who play very well, but not competitively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      So once you hit that road block, you can either sit down and accept your fate, or push yourself forward, for a little more pain. Because that's what it takes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The thing that gets most people is motivation. What's the point of doing better? Shouldn't I worry about X instead? (where X is making friends, having fun, etc)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Well, yes, you should worry about all of those; if you don't want to improve. You may say that this activity is entirely superficial. I have this goal that I want to work towards with this activity, that is directly contradictory to improvement. Then, yes, go for it. But why would you? How is improvement ever detrimental? How is making yourself stronger, faster, more prepared, more athletic, more nimble, more concentrated, more anything ever detrimental?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      Pain is temporary. Success is forever.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      In my eyes, I never see a reason I should be bad at something if I can do something about it. Why settle for anything that's less than perfect? Why live a life where you are just, mediocre. Why not aim as high as you can? When do you have anything to lose when you try your best at everything you do. Feel the pain, but reap the rewards.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      And I try not to make excuses about being bad either. If I screw up, then I screwed up. If I didn't work hard enough, then I didn't work hard enough. I lose because my opponent did everything better. And I know that I can definitely be at the same level as he or she, if I worked harder.
    &lt;/p&gt;s

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      Life is hard work. Improvement is hard work. You are only limited by yourself.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      At least, that's the attitude I once had. Now I'm working my way back up there. And above.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      You are bad, so deal with it.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Accepting that you are bad means that you understand that your way of thinking is incorrect; sub-optimal. That means you have to accept new methods and form new habits over what you have been doing before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      It's a tough process. But I like to think that the tougher it is, the more that final goal is worth fighting for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;sixteen columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Hey, where does Tetris come in?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Say in Tetris, you've been playing your style for 5-10 years. The traditional 1-line stack, like so.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;/images/tetris5.png&quot; title=&quot;1-line style&quot; rel=&quot;tetrisbasics&quot; class=&quot;fancybox&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/images/tetris5.png&quot; alt=&quot;1-line style&quot; class=&quot;scale-with-grid&quot; style=&quot;max-height:250px;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      You're so used to this style, that nothing else makes sense to you. 2-line stack? 3-line? t-spin? These are all foreign concepts because you've tunnel visioned yourself into 1-line. You never considered any other possibility because you didn't realize this one was bad. And now it's completely ingrained in your mental and muscle memory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When you finally realize you've been doing it wrong, it takes that mental effort to overcome your habits and rewire your brain. But oh boy, do you reap the rewards if you do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      You can also see how huge the benefits are if you start without any preconceived notions, and visualize your path right from the start. It gets you a huge advantage over other people who are trying to improve.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      By being open, either starting new or starting again, you can be more critical of all your decisions. Why place this block here? Why not over there? Why play this style? Why not... this? And if you are really innovative, you continue keeping your eyes open even as you get better. You notice the limitations, weaknesses, and strengths of each style and each decision. And you constantly question your decisions and your results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      The brightest people usually ask the most questions.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Here are the most basic styles people figured out, and easily enough to get you to level 100 in Tetris. You already saw the 1-line. The standard Tetris grid is 10x20(+2), 10 horizontal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;eight columns&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;console&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    :: 1-line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    _#########&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    _#########&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    _#########&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    _#########&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;eight columns&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;console&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    :: 2-line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    __######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    __######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    __######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    __######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;eight columns&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;console&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    :: 3-line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    ___######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    ___######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    ___######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    ___######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;eight columns&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;console&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    :: four-line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    ____######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    ____######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    ____######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    ____######&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;sixteen columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Start Anew&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      So let's start completely anew. Forget what you've seen and played of Tetris before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      If you look at your opponents, the first thing you see is that a lot of people who beat you, play this style where they hold an I-piece and make a block with 1-line, then drop two in a row. When you play people who just put pieces randomly, you can't really judge who's going to win or how the game is working. It seems more random, statistically.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      If you're really creative, you think, why do they only use this &quot;1-line&quot; style? Why not, &quot;2-line&quot;? Well, is the I-piece that important? The square piece seems to work the same way. Is there something else going on in the background?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Then you can draw some conclusions. Maybe if you clear more lines at once, you are stronger. Conceptually, this is combo-ing. Now, you can somewhat say, combo-ing is stronger than playing random, which is awesome to learn. And using some basic logic, you start to conclude that some combos are better than others, and if you use those more, maybe you are better than people who use them less. Excellent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Let's go back a little bit though. We thought that only the square piece works in the same way as the I-piece. Is that really so? Jumping forward a bit, and using a little knowledge of combos, we can sort of see that, wait a second, can't we just place any piece that fits in that slot? If you put a piece that has a width of 2 somewhere down the 2-line hole, you can see that it will clear a line. Try that several times, and you find out, hey, it's pretty strong! And conclude 2-line is better than 1-line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      So you learn that, hey, if you clear lines consecutively, it's a strong combo. That's an excellent observation again. Let's do the same experiment, but increase it to the 3-line style. You play a bit, trying to put pieces in that 3-line hole to form combos. And after a while, you realize, it's pretty strong! And conclude 3-line is better than 2-line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      You do the same thing with 4-line. Practice a lot, get better at pattern recognition and dropping into the 4-line hole. Eventually you find out that yep, in most cases, 4-line is better than 3-line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Now what about 5-line? Well, for as hard as you try, you can't get it better than 4-line. You start wondering why.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      So we should take a step back and try to figure out what's going on here. Why is 4-line &gt; 3-line, but not 5-line &gt; 4-line?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      If you look really carefully, you'll realize the strength of the combo is simply how many of them you can perform consecutively. 14 combos in a row is much better than 9 combos in a row. Now how does this apply to the n-line styles? Let's introduce this concept of a &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt;, of maximum size 20. The stack is how many lines you can possibly clear, so a basic limit on how many combos you can do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When you have 1-line, you force yourself into a strong, but quick 2 combo with the two I-lines in a row. Your stack of 20 is now 12, but you can't clear the rest of it because of the way your hole works. With the 2-line style, you start comboing a lot more, because your pieces can clear 1, 2, 3 lines at a time, and you have more blocks to work with. On average, you clear 2 or 3 lines at a time, so 20/3 is theoretically a consecutive combo of 7. In the 3-line style, you only clear 1 or 2 lines at a time, on average 1.5 times. So on a good play, you can look at a consecutive combo of 12. With 4-line, you can go up to 16.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      So now we determined that the higher the consecutive combo, the more deadly the combo is. This is amazing, and as far as I'll go. If you are really innovative, you will learn about the t-spin, and understand the t-spin process, but that is beyond a level I can describe with words.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For now, you can appreciate how your mind could possibly progress through thinking about Tetris.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;
        Practice makes Perfect
      &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Perfect means 100%, all the time. You usually miss out on that 'all the time' part. If you notice the arguments between accuracy and precision, you can be really precise, but only hit 75% on the dot every time. You can be really accurate, but only ever get around 90%. You are not perfect. And no one expects you to be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      What you do have control over though is your consistency. You can't be 100% all the time, but you can be 90% all the time. And once you're 90% all the time, making small changes can slowly push you towards 100% all the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Games are notoriously good at creating randomness. Think about a free throw shot in basketball. What percentage of that is random, and hard work? Are the best players not sinking the ball almost 95% of the time? High accuracy, high precision. Not perfect, but really, really good.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Increasing that level of randomness is that, even though you perform really well, it's not a guarantee that you win.
      &lt;a href=&quot;/images/tetris3.png&quot; title=&quot;Score high but lose&quot; rel=&quot;tetrisbasics&quot; class=&quot;fancybox&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/images/tetris3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Score high but lose&quot; class=&quot;scale-with-grid&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      If you make a mistake in Tetris at the high levels, you'll probably lose outright. In reality, at high levels, it's more about who can make the least mistakes while performing at the highest level, rather than who can perform at the highest level, though we somewhat use highest level interchangeably with best and winning performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Mental attitude and practice are huge components of maintaining consistency, but also fatigue. If you practice something a lot, it makes sense that you'll be able to do it longer. However, there is still a limit, and once you cross it, your performance drops dramatically. It's important to keep this in mind, and take frequent breaks, mentally, and for your hands.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Consistency across an entire game is also just as important. Understand that you will be judged on your worst performance, not your best. Doing poorly even once can be devastating and cost you the game. I remember once where I was 3KO'd by my opponent 30 seconds into the match. I didn't panic, and continued playing a solid, consistent game. I crawled my way back in, he choked a little in the last 30 seconds, and I beat him 4-3. I didn't panic because I knew my game was super tight and consistent. I was comfortable because my pace was strong and my style didn't sacrifice attacking potential. And if I play the style properly, I definitely have a chance. I don't alternate between conservative and aggressive on a whim. I am comfortable the entire game.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      As a bit of higher strategy, I don't let my playstyle dictate my pace, like 1-line players do. I attack when I sense weakness, then wait for my next move. I am comfortable at any point because I can control the flow of the game.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When you reach a point where building up is done by reflex, you notice you can employ a lot more strategies. Namely, staring at your opponent's screen and seeing when to attack. Anticipation. Prediction. You'll also notice that you can effectively use the line-clearing bombs a lot more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When you have a strong foundation, you can add new skills very easily, and they will seem so much more useful and intuitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <updated>2012-08-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/18/tetris</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;sixteen columns&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I recently achieved my 3 month goal of getting to level 95 in Tetris Friends Battle, so here's some Tetris. ^^
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Tetris&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Tetris is played all around the world, with good reason. It's very addictive, easily accessible to all ages, has a high skill ceiling for improvement and the Tetris &lt;span class=&quot;italics&quot;&gt;tune&lt;/span&gt; is just plain catchy. It has become one of those words that everyone knows, regardless of culture, race, age or job.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            However, you can easily when Tetris can become a monotonous grind. While the levelling system pushes the speed of the game up, the skill ceiling and time commitment goes exponentially up with no other gains, other than the joy of being really good. Which is sometimes enough. But over time, this monotonous grind loses the casual base. Sure, every once in a while you'll squeek out a quick Tetris game since it's good for your health. Once and done for a while, though.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But enter Tetris Friends.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tetrisfriends.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tetris Friends&lt;/a&gt; hit the world via Facebook, and it spread like wildfire in its first few years. Now, it has seemed to die down, but it took the great Tetris formula, kept all the fun of stacking blocks, added enough social and game elements to cause Tetris's recent resurgence.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            It actually wouldn't be wrong to say Tetris Friends is a strong reason as to why Tetris is still on a lot of people's minds.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;What makes a Tetris&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Because Tetris has become so mainstream, a lot of its meaning has been lost. The basics of the game are very easy to pick up, but there are a lot of nuances different versions have added that people say improve or detract from the game. I tend to think most of them improved upon an already winning formula.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The point of regular Tetris is to finish the game. Many variants set the bar at level 20. Some have a limitless mode. More hardcore clones like ones posted on Youtube go invincibly fast, then turn off the pieces so you play blind and by memory.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The end goal is always to get the highest score possible. How? To make lots and lots of Tetrises. In the world of stacking and clearing size-4 blocks, a Tetris is clearing 4 lines at the same time with the 'I' block.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            An equally viable method is to get lots of T-spins, which involve making a spin left or spin right in the half second when the block is about to drop onto the stack.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            These are really simple concepts. T-spin was not in the original Tetris, but you can imagine how much more depth it brings to the game.
            Tetris Friends does even more to this formula.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;What makes a Tetris friendly?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            While T-spins and Tetrises have become fundamental to the game, they don't add the much needed 'game' elements that makes a game really successful. Being a puzzle game is often enough to garner interest, but what really pushed Tetris into the mainstream is really making it more friendly to new players by introducing a lot of new, cool and most importantly fun elements.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;Facebook Integration&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Perhaps the most important element of Tetris Friend's success is their integration into Facebook. Recently passing 1 billion users, Facebook is by far the most successful and widespread social platform. By integrating an application successfully into Facebook's network, you can interact with all those users, which is a huge market and makes the game very accessible compared to client downloads.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;Game Modes&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Tetris Friends put a bunch of game modes on the grid, and made them accessible to a lot of people very easily with their integration with Facebook.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Sprint races players against other players to see who can clear the fastest 40 lines. Marathon is like limitless mode, but amplifies the speed and point progression a lot better than other game variants do. Battle 2P and 6P pits players against players in a refreshing take on the Tetris formula. These modes work heavily to improve the replayability of the game by switching up the skills required to succeed in each, and expand the skill sets of the players.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/images/tetris4.png&quot; title=&quot;Battle 2P Mode&quot; rel=&quot;tetris&quot; class=&quot;fancybox&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/images/tetris4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Battle 2P Mode&quot; class=&quot;scale-with-grid&quot; style=&quot;max-height:400px;&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But what game modes do is simply reward and spread player improvement equally. While Battle 2P is always the premier game mode, being good at any of the game modes automatically makes you better in other game modes, and this adds to the time spent in each mode. Get good at Sprint and suddenly you'll want to be as good in Batle 2P as you are in Sprint. Which brings me to my next point.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;Rankings&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Basic Tetris has no metric on where your skill level stands. While you can judge a fair bit by saying, &quot;Oh, I can't beat level 14&quot;, beyond these generic statements you have no information.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            By including this ranking solution, you can suddenly compare yourself to your friends: boast, cry, whatever. You have a standard, physical goal to work towards. You have a lot more concrete information to judge your own performance in that you're weak in sprints, but good at battles.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            My personal favourite element of their ranking system is that it makes you feel good.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you keep track of the labels they have defined for the ranking system, you will notice it is always positive. And this is amazing in keeping you interested. Do you want to be called a Hero or a noob? So instead of insults, we get all these Tetris Gods Grandmasters, Rock Stars and so on. It's amazing how they decided to keep the attitude positive like this, and how effective it is.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Some people will argue that it hides information a lot more, but in reality, good players don't care about their label. They don't even care about the number. But improving or stalled players don't need to feel bad about being stuck at the Grandmaster level this way.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Plus, the name obscures the fact that the skill level is dramatically higher at the top levels. An extremely interesting observation I found with Starcraft is that the professional gamers, the highest tier of players, are at a skill level way beyond even the top players. If you are familiar with the Starcraft 2 rankings, it goes
            &lt;code&gt;Bronze &amp;lt; Silver &amp;lt; Gold &amp;lt; Platinum &amp;lt; Diamond &amp;lt; Masters &amp;lt; Grandmasters&lt;/code&gt;
             where Grandmaster represents the top 200 players, and Masters represents the top 2% of the Diamond ranking. In this same example, you can easily see how someone in Diamond who is not award of Masters may think that he is one of the best players, and this makes him continue playing. I mean, Diamond sounds like it's a pretty high rank, no? The same thing applies in Tetris Friends.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/images/tetrisranks.png&quot; title=&quot;Already an expert at level 13!&quot; rel=&quot;tetris&quot; class=&quot;fancybox&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/images/tetrisranks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Already an expert at level 13!&quot; class=&quot;scale-with-grid&quot; style=&quot;max-height:400px;&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Expert at level 13!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;Rewards&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And then adding rewards keep you coming back to the game. A really annoying, yet smart decision was to include a slot system where you opened more slots the more consecutive days you played. Diabolical? yes. Smart? yes. And running these slots more meant you got more Tetris money to spend for Tetris: adding skins, getting slight gaming tweaks. Rewards keep you coming back to play more.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/images/tetris1.png&quot; title=&quot;Keep playing with slots&quot; rel=&quot;tetris&quot; class=&quot;fancybox&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/images/tetris1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Keep playing with slots&quot; class=&quot;scale-with-grid&quot; style=&quot;max-height:400px;&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Tetris Friends just does so many things right, it's very easy to see how it has become so successful. And hopefully you can see how much it more it brings to the base Tetris game. However, it will need to continue to innovate and improve the user experience, because being a Tetris clone, there is definitely a limit to how many blocks casual gamers can handle stacking before moving on.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title type="html">some cables feel really nice</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/11/reallynicecables"/>
   <updated>2012-08-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/11/reallynicecables</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I recently gained possession of a really nice pair of cables. 1/4&quot; male to 1/4&quot; male. Nothing 
  special really, except the cable feels really nice.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; 
  I have a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moon-audio.com/audio-cables/moon-audio-headphone-cables/moon-audio-blue-dragon-headphone-cable.html&quot;&gt;Blue Dragon&lt;/a&gt; cables from Moon-Audio. Apparently it's surrounded by Kevlar
  and Teflon tape. Yum. That link isn't the same pair, but it's close. It feels like a really high quality 
  braided cable. All newer Razer peripherals come braided with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.theendearingdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Razer-Naga-Gaming-Mouse-Review14.jpg&quot;&gt;cloth like material&lt;/a&gt;. 
  It feels nice, but the Blue Dragon cable is less flexible, with a really strong and plasticky feel. 
  It feels amazing.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  My new cable feels even better. It's completely rubberized, which isn't something I've seen a lot.
  The rubber is really textured, unlike the smooth plasticky rubber on a lot of cables. It's 
  made by Fender, and says Professional Noiseless Cable on the cable itself. I don't know why that message is required. 
  Isn't that expected of every cable? 
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Oh well. It feels so nice I don't mind.
&lt;/p&gt;

   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/03/dexpot"/>
   <updated>2012-08-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/08/03/dexpot</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Workspaces are brilliant. I fell in love with them the first time I used Ubuntu, but I still preferred Windows. The problem? Windows doesn't have workspaces... by default. So I found them.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;What are workspaces?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  If you haven't checked out the introduction video on &lt;a href=&quot;http://dexpot.de/&quot;&gt;dexpot.de&lt;/a&gt;, get over there and take a look. If you want more try &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaces_(software)&quot;&gt;Spaces (wiki)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workspace#Graphical_interfaces&quot;&gt;workspaces (wiki)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Workspaces simply make your screen bigger. You can have more windows open at the same time. All it takes to see them is a hotkey press, instead of &lt;code&gt;alt+tab&lt;/code&gt;. If you know me, I love being more productive, and doing more, faster. So workspaces just make sense.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  The most costly transition time is between your mouse and your keyboard. Less so for laptops. And then your second most costly transition time is opening another window, say with &lt;code&gt;alt+tab&lt;/code&gt;. Try using &lt;code&gt;alt+tab&lt;/code&gt; when you have more than 6 applications or tabs open. Workspaces help you try to bypass that.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Let's start with laptops. If you work on a laptop, you sometimes run out of space. Let's run through a use case, because examples are more useful productivity-wise.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Writing an Essay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Say you're writing an essay. If you are on a laptop, Microsoft Word is already taking up 2/3 the screen space. What's left? A little slice of the screen where you can look at some references to help you. This is bad.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Enter workspaces. Now, instead of putting the two windows in the same screen, we can split them up. Put Window 1 as the Word Document. Window 2 will have a reference page. Window 3 will have another reference page. Windows 4 will have another page, or iTunes so you can change the music every once in a while.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Now, you can write a bit in the Word document, realize you need to quickly reference something, and instead of the costly and inaccurate &lt;code&gt;alt+tab&lt;/code&gt;, press two keys and your document shows up, read a little, press two keys and right back to work. Your hands never left the keyboard. Fast? Yes. Useful? Hell yes.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Setup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  In general, I use it more to zone out my desktop. I hate clutter, especially on my computer screen, because it interferes with my thoughts. So I designate Window 4 as my music window, Window 3 as my background window, and Window 1 as my productive window. I can swap between them with ease. As a testament to this, I haven't used &lt;code&gt;alt+tab&lt;/code&gt; in such a long time, I actually forgot what the keys were.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Because I am primarily on my desktop, I have a second monitor, usually for referencing. So my screen space is suddenly huge and the amount of information I can get within a millisecond click is so much more productive.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Why Dexpot?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  So why Dexpot specifically? Well, I haven't found any other workspace application in Windows, and I don't need to. Since the first time I used Dexpot, they added multi-monitor configuration, seriously stabilized the build, increased responsivenesss, increased speed, and added a ton more features that I can't even list. It's simply the best application out there. I prefer it even to Ubuntu's native workspaces.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  You can define your own hotkeys to switch between tabs. You can define how you switch between tabs. You can write launch conditions that automatically send programs to specifically windows. You can set switch conditions that keep an application on a window if you switch windows. There is so much functionality, it's ridiculous.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I also really like the preview functions.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/images/dexpot1.png&quot; title=&quot;workspace preview is pretty cool&quot; rel=&quot;tetris&quot; class=&quot;fancybox&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/images/dexpot1.png&quot; alt=&quot;workspace preview is pretty cool&quot; class=&quot;scale-with-grid&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  The hotkeys are more intuitive for one-handed productivity. Having one hand on the mouse is a lot more flexible. But Ubuntu requires a &lt;code&gt;WIN+ARROW_KEY&lt;/code&gt; to swap the workspace. A pretty big waste of time to move one hand over from the mouse. Dexpot's solution? &lt;code&gt;ALT+#NUM&lt;/code&gt;. Simple and fast. Or, it can be &lt;code&gt;WIN+ARROW_KEY&lt;/code&gt;. Highly customizable, so anything you want.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  The difference in productivity is pretty astounding once you're used to it. Give it a go &lt;a href=&quot;http://dexpot.de/?id=download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        We all have a finite number of keyboard presses in our lifetime, so we should do our best to increase the output of each press.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        We should try to do as much as we can with as little effort as we can manage, so we don't waste our valuable keypresses doing something that could've been done easier.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title type="html">Dropbox</title>
   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/07/26/dropbox"/>
   <updated>2012-07-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/07/26/dropbox</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropbox.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; just saved me weeks of pain, so here it goes.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  If the Dropbox introduction video doesn't convince you, here is my real world use of Dropbox.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Case 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I'm a University student that lives away from home. I decided to bring my desktop to my new residence. I also bought a new laptop so I could work outside of my residence.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Here's the problem, all my files are out of sync. I can work on one of my essays after class in one of the many labs across campus. But once I get home, either I can only work on the essay on my laptop, or get a USB drive, move it to my desktop and work a bit. And if I want to work outside in one of the labs again? Save it to the USB, transfer it to my laptop and get going.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  While this is possible, it's just a massive waste of time if you compare it to better solutions. This is where Dropbox comes in. If instead of putting that file on my USB, I save it to my Dropbox folder, I can reach it wherever I have an Internet connection because it will sync to my computer.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/images/dropbox.png&quot; title=&quot;automatically synchronizing&quot; rel=&quot;tetris&quot; class=&quot;fancybox&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/dropbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;automatically synchronizing&quot; class=&quot;scale-with-grid&quot; style=&quot;max-height:400px;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  If I take the time to set up the desktop Dropbox application, I can do even better. Create a folder structure inside the Dropbox folder that's automatically set up, and it will sync all my changes immediately online, and to any places I have Dropbox online.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  If I open my laptop and my desktop at the same time, I can sync my files across computers immediately, in real time. That saves a lot of time.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Case 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  If you've ever forgotten work at home before, you'll kick yourself for not using Dropbox.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I save all my work on my Dropbox folder. Due to a special promotion, it has over 20GB of storage currently. What this means is that anywhere I have an active Internet connection, I can retrieve any of my work.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I used to email myself my homework so that I could print it out, say at school. Use Dropbox, and I can skip the email part completely.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I remember once going to a lab, but forgetting about bringing the required code. Not a problem, because it's right there, saved on my Dropbox.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Having things on the cloud, even if it's not cloud storage like Dropbox, is ridiculously useful.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Setup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I am very organized, and I have a lot of space on my Dropbox, so I save, name and date all of my school work, side projects, and other random useful things that I might need. It's so convenient having them on the Dropbox folder, because now they appear on all the computers that I use. And everytime I make a change on one computer, all the other computers will be guaranteed to have the same change.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I use Dropbox to complement GitHub. While I like the idea of GitHub, the downtime between pushing a change and fetching it on a new computer is a bit too high. Since my projects aren't that large, I can use Dropbox along with it. I synchronize all my project files so that wherever I am and whichever computer I'm using, I can still commit some changes to the project. It's a bit faster, though it means I don't get to use Git as much.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Actually, this system caused me a bit of trouble when I almost deleted my entire website. I was learning and trying out a lot of new stuff for the new site, but I hadn't committed any changes. Then I did some weird things, and all of my new changes were deleted. I didn't want to roll back and start all over, so I panicked.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  It turns out I was saved by Dropbox, since the web application keeps a track of recent changes. So I could go on the site and recover all the files I lost. It was basically a life saver, so every few days I thank Dropbox for its services, and still kind of marvel at how amazing the idea is.
&lt;/p&gt;

   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/07/20/justgoforit"/>
   <updated>2012-07-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/07/20/justgoforit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  When people ask for motivation, it's really hard to give them a straight answer. 
  I never had one myself. But recently, I've had some really bad problems that 
  left me scratching my head. I couldn't solve it, and there was nothing I could do.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  But then I came along a couple of really good motivational posts, which really,
  in essence, told me to do it because failure is not an option. Mediocrity is not an option. 
  You don't have the time to be mediocre, because every second spent fixing your mediocrity
  is a second not spent getting ahead. 
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  My motivation was always really,
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &quot;Do it because you can. Do it to prove to yourself that you can.
    Do it 100% because when it's all over, you don't matter unless you're better than the rest.&quot;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  But as the time passed by, I began to realize that I grew into a habit of.. mediocrity. It might be because the education
  system doesn't really teach, and some life-changing realizations I've made since. 
  But I shouldn't be making excuses for my failures, because there isn't time in life to do this.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I can't let one little thing, one little portion of my life, set me back so much of that time. Just as much as I can't do something
  50%, and then complain about it later on.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Screw the motivation. Just do it.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  This is a pretty rose-tinted view of it, but a little bit applicable at least. &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/Sk56VxaeqEQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Best Motivation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  My favourite quote?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &quot;You need to ask yourself, 'what are you going to do today,' &lt;br /&gt;
      but more importantly, 'how are you going to do it.'&quot;
        &lt;cite&gt;Jaret Grossman&lt;/cite&gt;

   <link href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/07/11/counter-memories"/>
   <updated>2012-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/07/11/counter-memories</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Sometimes, the oddest of circumstances makes you remember things you did in 
  the past, that somehow you forgot over the years. And most of the time, it puts a 
  really big smile on your face when you think about how simple times were.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; 
  I was having an innocent argument with an artist about stuff that we've made in the 
  past. While my friend is clearly the better artist between the two of us, I remembered
  that I really wanted to be a (graphic) artist at some point in my life.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Since Grade 5 or 6, I have always been the biggest Counter-Strike fan, until some 
  tragic event a couple of years ago that forced me to quit. I played a lot of Counter-Strike, 
  so I'm pretty sure my 662 HOURS PLAYED on Steam is inaccurate. In my spare time then, 
  I thought about Counter-Strike a lot. Fiddled with the backend graphics; new scripts, new models,
  new decals. 
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  My Grade 9 Art mark was an astounding 100, a surprise, even to myself. I think my 
  Art teacher had a lot of hope in me, and was probably a little heartbroken when me 
  and my friend (who also got 100), decided not to take Grade 10 Art.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I had before stumbled upon a thriving online game modding community in 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fpsbanana.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FPSBanana&lt;/a&gt;. I was hooked.
  I vividly remember seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamebanana.com/members/164481&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Teh Snake&lt;/a&gt;.
  He made many brilliant and amazing mods, and quite possibly the reason I wanted to go into graphic design.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Eventually, I tried my hand at modding, and upon realizing I hadn't the talent or the experience,
  I tried something much, much easier, and something that brings me a little bit of joy to see online now.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I made a custom hand skin for Counter-Strike after collaborating a bit with the original owner, Nasaratsu.
  Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamebanana.com/cscz/skins/48319&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, and while it's 
  really bad, I'm still extremely proud of it. Over 6,000 downloads, and 14,000 views. :')

    I had an interview the other day that really shook me up.

    He asked me a question that really made me wonder how much I really knew about programming. 
    I really thought I knew Python (at least somewhat decently), but I understand now there's a difference between using a language a few times, and actually knowing the language in and out.

    My answer was... &quot;crap.&quot; I did not know what to do really, and it cost me the interview. I was ashamed, and now that I try it, I should've known it. 

    The question was (I think): 
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;console&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;Remove the first letter from each word in the string: &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;asdf das f po&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    EDIT(2012-07-16): This was my March attempt.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# removes spaces from string&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;original&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39; &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
        
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newline&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# removes first letter of each word from string and fixes spacing&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;original&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newword&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newword&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
            
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newword&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39; &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newline&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    EDIT [20120716]: How did I not realize how bad this was back when I wrote it? 
    Wow. Just wow. I don't know how I made it this far programming if that was the best I could 
    come up with. Honest.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;removefirstletter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sentence&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sentence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    Easily handles any issue with spacing when you remove the word with one letter.

    The output should be 
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;console&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;df as o&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
    I'd like to think I made progress, but this could be done a lot better still. 
    But if I got this far in 3 months, I'm can't think of the possibilities in a couple years!

    This is my first post. So, an obligatory
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
