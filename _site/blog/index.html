    Awesome! I was a bit busy with school work a couple weeks ago, but I managed to watch the <a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/TeamLiquid:_Attack!">TeamLiquid Attack!</a> episode with <a href="http://white-ra.com/">White-Ra</a>. 
</p>




<p>
    TeamLiquid Attack! is a Starcraft show where professional Starcraft gamers come play against community members as a sort of fan service. Guest casters, usually other community members, stream the matches to the community. If you want to play against them, you have to guess a trivia question they ask on the stream, or be really really lucky.
</p>




<p>
    <a href="http://youtu.be/Mg19xi2vERA?t=33m49s">Here I am</a> in the final game, a 3v3 against iNcontroL, CatZ and White-Ra. I'm the Zerg who kills the Probe. :D
</p>




<p>
    I was actually too nervous during the entire game because I was freaking out from playing since I never win anything. I think I was screaming like a fangirl the entire time. It was so awesome.

    For an assignment in my CS241 class, we had to link two <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/merl/merl.html">MERL files</a> by hand. I didn't want to do this, but I didn't understand the concept of linking MERL files well enough to program a linker to do it for me. I finished the assignment by hand, and after doing that, I could finally complete this linker I was working on. It was an interesting lesson to learn.
</p>




<p>
    I really enjoyed writing the linker, because it was fun to implement an algorithm to parse the input the output with classes, even though my solution is very primitive.
</p>




<p>
    I found out a slightly annoying limitation of Python that I must look for a solution around in the future. Apparently I can't directly read the MERL file directly, so my program's input has to be an xdd file, after running the UNIX xxd utility. Annoying, but I will live with it in the meantime.
</p>




<p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">xxd -c 4 file1.merl &gt; file1.xxd</span>
<span class="go">xxd -c 4 file2.merl &gt; file2.xxd</span>
<span class="go">python linker.py file1.xxd file2.xxd output.txt</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

</p>




<p>
    I put the code up <a href="https://github.com/Blisse/MERL-Linker">here</a>.

    My university is decently funded, so across the campus, there are a lot of lab stations where groups of students can sit by a computer and work on
    their assignments, or for those without a computer at home, just surf the web freely. Everyday, the most popular lab areas are always nearly full. Students can bring their laptops and set up a little study area around one of the lab computers, or take a small island of tables and work in a group. It's really convenient.
</p>




<p>
    I sometimes visit these labs. I enjoy the environment and atmosphere. There's a quiet respect for everyone in the area, with a couple exceptions. Something I hate, but is necessary, is that they bolt the machines and monitors to the tables, so I can't hook the monitor to my laptop as a second screen, but it's not that much of a loss with workspaces and <a href="http://localhost:4000/archive/2012/08/03/index.html">Dexpot</a>. However, something else always bugged me when I was at the labs, and today I finally realized what it was.
</p>




<p>
    <div class="subheader">
        Either the chairs are too low, or the tables are too high.
    </div>
</p>




<p>
    I didn't think I would notice, but I did. Ergonomics are always a concern of mine. I actually thought I had developed RSI a couple years ago when my wrists ached constantly. It turned out my wrists were just digging into the edge of the table too much, but it did make me much more aware of how my desk positioned my body throughout the day.
</p>




<p>
    Well, I can safely say that the tables and chairs in the common lab room promote abhorrent posture. According to and not limited by all the following sources, your arm should form an angle greater than 90 degrees at the elbow, and the upper arm should be horizontal to the floor. Your legs should be flat on the floor, and your back to the chair.

    <div class="subheader">
        Guess how many sites recommend sitting in the position the E5 lab promotes? 
        <br/>...
        <br/>None.
    </div>
</p>




<p>
     That's it then. I guess I will have to see what rooms actually condone proper ergonomics. Along the way I might creep some people out, but some things must be sacrificed in the sake of the science. <span class="bold">*cough*</span> I'll keep you posted after I scour UWaterloo for some good seats.

  Not as pretty as it could be, but it works fairly well. <a href="http://pastebin.com/aySiHjUW">Here's the result from my pastebin.</a>
</p>




<p>
  Ignoring non-ASCII characters, I get 5340 matches for words that total to 100. 
  'Inefficient' appears on there, so I have proven that first image is false with this contradiction.
</p>




<p>
  Other interesting words that appear for word_score == 100 are:
    <ul class="square">
      <li>excellent</li>
      <li>snobbery</li>
      <li>socialism</li>
      <li>reengineer</li>
      <li>practicing</li>
      <li>defeminized</li>

  So, that looks like any image file, no? Actually, if you look at its source, it's really just a big line of text.
  I can't say I know too much about what's really behind it, but the line of text is a data URL, developed for the Data URI scheme (Uniform Resource Identifier scheme), which
  according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>, was made specifically for 
  embedding images in a single file, rather than using conventional external images.
</p>




<p>
  Reading a bit more, a uniform resource identifier is a string of characters that identifies a name or resource. 
  So a filepath will do, but also the Data URL, which breaks the resource data into a base64-encoded string.
</p>




<p>
  Using <a href="http://dataurl.net/#dataurlmaker" target="_blank">dataurl.net</a>, you can convert most images to get a 
  Data URL, which you can then link to in your HTML file via

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;data:url&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

</p>




<p>
  It's a pretty nifty little piece of code.
</p>




<p>
  In other news, the new site is up and running. I think it's a bit better than before.

  I really like gaming. There is something beautiful about immersing yourself completely in the game.
  Losing yourself completely in this reality, and escaping the physical world. It is the same feeling I 
  try to get to when I'm listening to music. Bliss.
</p>




<p>
  Lately, I've been following the emerging e-sports scene; gamers pushing towards making gaming a sport, 
  a thriving, sustainable industry with actual careers. The main game responsible? StarCraft.
</p>




<p>
  For the last 14 years, StarCraft and StarCraft:Brood War (I will refer to both as just BW), has been a huge 
  commercial success. But only in South Korea, where the best progamers compete in packed stadiums in front of
  screaming Korean fangirls, for huge grand prizes and honour, in two competitive proleagues, with top
  salaries in the 100K's. That's just, ridiculous to think about, but it's happened.
</p>




<p>
  But this success was not met across the globe. While the Korean community thrived, the Western community was much 
  more recluse. StarCraft wasn't as big; actually, Counter-Strike was the thing. But there were many strong contenders
  underground, who moved to Korea to train with the best. The Western scene was okay, but left much to be desired
  for the players.
</p>




<p>
  With the launch of StarCraft 2 (SC2), Blizzard, the developers, decided to take the huge success of BW and expand it across 
  the globe; the push for e-sports began. 2 years later, it's really obvious how much of an impact this has had. 
  Competitive gaming has become mainstream. Popularized by League of Legends, Defense of the Ancients 1 and 2, 
  Heroes of Newerth, Call of Duty, Halo, and StarCraft 2, gamers across the globe have ridiculously easier access to these games.
  It's easy to talk to a few friends about what's going on in the competitive scene, participate in some fantasy leagues, and even
  attend live events. 
</p>




<p>
  So what's missing for the Western world? Taking a look at Korean BW, and European Counter-Strike, you can see
  something that's really surprising. Gamers, and the people around them, are surprisingly professional. Not only 
  in actions, but appearance. Most people still have the idea that gaming is only for 'nerds'. And currently, it's hard
  to disagree with them. While the competitive scenes have a fair share of exceptions, they are still the exception. 
  It is difficult for the mainstream society to enjoy watching a scrawny, freckled teenager with mismatched clothes win 
  several thousand dollars, as bad as that sounds. Western society has this huge emphasis on appearance that many gamers lack.
</p>




<p>
  However, it doesn't have to be that way. <a href="http://youtu.be/VWOIgB37LKQ" target="_blank">This</a> is SK|HeatoN, who was
  part of a very successful Counter-Strike team. And he looks and acts perfectly. If you watch Korean BW on television (yes, this exists),
  you'll see the commentators are exactly like that as well. Casual, yet professional. Same with the players, respectful and professional.
  Some of the players have even modeled. Image sells.
</p>




<p>
  While it's really enticing to have a thriving competitive scene where everyone is judgment-free and accepting of the geeky
  and nerdy tendencies of many gamers, it's important to the mainstream (and the sponsors) that there is some sort of 
  professional image put forth. There must be some agreement between all gamers that gaming can be your career, your life's work;
  if you take gaming seriously. If you treat video games like just a game, how are you going to convince someone it's also 
  a sport, and more importantly, how can you convince someone to make it a career?

  I'm working on my Poker game, and it's always the same story.
</p>




<p>
  I always find that the hardest part is not the logic, but getting it playable. 
  I seem to always be torn between optimizing now so that I don't write horrible 
  code for future me to debug, and just getting it down. It's starting to get really annoying. 
  It's like some form of writer's block; for programmers. There's just so much I want to do
  and so little time to do it, I'm stuck deciding what to do instead of just going for it.
</p>




<p>
  I think my best plan of attack is to just make it playable as soon 
  as possible. I don't think I should worry about optimizing now, even if it means 
  I'll have a harder job in the future. Hey, it'd be good experience to weed through really,
  really bad code.

      I don't know who said it, but it's true. If you want to get better, more often than not you'll have to do worse.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exact reason? People are bad. A pretty pessimistic view, but completely justified. Since our birth, we're are
      bombarded with a lot of information, especially so in this day and age. And it's our job to filter out what's good and
      what's bad. However, sometimes before we realize it, we'll have made this decision unconsciously. Perhaps you played a game for 
      a long time without a good strategy guide. Or perhaps you learned math one way instead of another. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you've used this 'bad style' for 5-10 years, and it's so ingrained into your being that you don't even think about why
      you do it this way and what other ways there are. When you realize you've been doing it wrong the entire time, it takes a 
      tremendous amount of effort to break your old habits and rewire that muscle memory. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So when you are able to see directly where you want to go <b>right</b> from the beginning, and visualize the route you're going to take, and
      actually have that happening to you, it gives you a huge advantage over others. At least, it gave me a big advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's not to say people were playing <span class="italics">wrong</span>. If we didn't have the advantage of the Internet, and all its
      information, what normal people would have been doing so far just seems right. But innovators don't think like that. They kept their eyes open. 
      They noticed the implications, the limits and weaknesses of each style, and kept questioning all their decisions. Certainly a revolutionary 
      and enviable way of thinking. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The new generation only play in a one-line style. And some get really good with it. But they've been tunnel-visioned into this style.
      They're not open to new ideas, and they don't have the experience of swapping styles and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.
      At low to mid-levels of Tetris, combo-ing is the most effective way to play, yet most players don't realize this because they only play
      their one-line style. For fun, that's fine. To get good? We'll need something else.

      These are examples of the styles. The standard Tetris grid is 10x20(+2), 10 horizontal. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To the left, with the one-line style, one space is left empty and you
      build upwards from there. In two-line, two spaces are left empty, and so on. The two-line style is the easiest to play, and easily beats the one-line 
      if you play at the same level. Why? Like I said, combo-ing is the best way to begin, and the two-line is almost a guaranteed combo chain everytime you start.
      Why? Well if you took the time to think about it a bit, it'd make perfect sense. Every single Tetris piece except the I-piece will continue a combo
      if you drop it in the 2-block wide hole because every block except the I-piece has a width of 2 somewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next thing you'll notice is then how high combos are devastating, so you'll want as high a combo as possible. To get that, you'll find it's best to only clear
      one line when you're combo-ing. Done well enough, you can possibly have a 13-14 consecutive combo, which is very, very strong. But to get that, you have to 
      realize that two-line isn't the only style to play. That's very easy when you have already realized that one-line isn't the only style to play and then 
      moved on to two-line. But think about all the one-line players who haven't realized this. You have to question yourself at every turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Playing well doesn't mean you'll perform well however. A large component of improving in Tetris is consistency. There is almost zero room for mistakes.
      And if you do make a mistake, you need to have the foresight to minimize its effects, and fix it, because it is very costly to the consecutive combo-ing if you
      aren't careful. Multiple mistakes, and you can probably forfeit the game already if you're playing at very high levels. Consistency requires stamina, of course, 
      and you'll notice as you play more, your performance will degrade at times. It's important to take frequent breaks, and eventually you'll notice you can play for 2 hours 
      without severe performance degradation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Consistency throughout multiple games is important, but also consistency throughout every single game. Play the beginning exactly like how you would play out the
      ending. Calmly and quickly. If you play the entire match at <span class="italics">your</span> pace, you won't lose simply because you messed up once. Every portion of 
      your game will be dangerous. I have been down 2 or 3 KOs multiple times right at the start of the game, but I pace myself. I can came back and win,
      simply because I'm playing this strong, fast pace where I don't make mistakes, yet not sacrifice attacking potential. The pace I set for myself is supremely comfortable
      because it's the only pace I play at. I don't alternate at random between conservative and aggressive. I don't let my playstyle dictate my pace, as one-line players must do.
      I don't feel panicked down 0-3 as much as I should because I know if I simply play the style properly, I can come back. Being comfortable is very important.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually you can reach a point where building up your stack is almost done by reflex, and you will notice you have a lot more freedom and time to stare at your 
      opponent's game and <span class="italics">predict</span> what he'll do, and then play your own side in anticipation. This is a very strong strategy, 
      and combined with a strong foundation will improve your game dramatically.. And because you have such a strong core already, adding things like 
      prediction or ending strongly or beginning combos will have much more visible effects.

            I recently achieved my 3 month goal of getting to level 95 in Tetris Friends Battle, so here's some Tetris. ^^
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Tetris</h4>
        </p>

        <p>
            Tetris is played all around the world, with good reason. It's very addictive, easily accessible to all ages, has a high skill ceiling for improvement and the Tetris <span class="italics">tune</span> is just plain catchy. It has become one of those words that everyone knows, regardless of culture, race, age or job.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, you can easily when Tetris can become a monotonous grind. While the levelling system pushes the speed of the game up, the skill ceiling and time commitment goes exponentially up with no other gains, other than the joy of being really good. Which is sometimes enough. But over time, this monotonous grind loses the casual base. Sure, every once in a while you'll squeek out a quick Tetris game since it's good for your health. Once and done for a while, though.
        </p>

        <p>
            But enter Tetris Friends.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="http://www.tetrisfriends.com/" target="_blank">Tetris Friends</a> hit the world via Facebook, and it spread like wildfire in its first few years. Now, it has seemed to die down, but it took the great Tetris formula, kept all the fun of stacking blocks, added enough social and game elements to cause Tetris's recent resurgence.
        </p>

        <p>
            It actually wouldn't be wrong to say Tetris Friends is a strong reason as to why Tetris is still on a lot of people's minds.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>What makes a Tetris</h4>
        </p>

        <p>
            Because Tetris has become so mainstream, a lot of its meaning has been lost. The basics of the game are very easy to pick up, but there are a lot of nuances different versions have added that people say improve or detract from the game. I tend to think most of them improved upon an already winning formula.
        </p>

        <p>
            The point of regular Tetris is to finish the game. Many variants set the bar at level 20. Some have a limitless mode. More hardcore clones like ones posted on Youtube go invincibly fast, then turn off the pieces so you play blind and by memory.
        </p>

        <p>
            The end goal is always to get the highest score possible. How? To make lots and lots of Tetrises. In the world of stacking and clearing size-4 blocks, a Tetris is clearing 4 lines at the same time with the 'I' block.
        </p>

        <p>
            An equally viable method is to get lots of T-spins, which involve making a spin left or spin right in the half second when the block is about to drop onto the stack.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are really simple concepts. T-spin was not in the original Tetris, but you can imagine how much more depth it brings to the game.
            Tetris Friends does even more to this formula.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>What makes a Tetris friendly?</h4>
        </p>

        <p>
            While T-spins and Tetrises have become fundamental to the game, they don't add the much needed 'game' elements that makes a game really successful. Being a puzzle game is often enough to garner interest, but what really pushed Tetris into the mainstream is really making it more friendly to new players by introducing a lot of new, cool and most importantly fun elements.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5>Facebook Integration</h5>
        </p>

        <p>
            Perhaps the most important element of Tetris Friend's success is their integration into Facebook. Recently passing 1 billion users, Facebook is by far the most successful and widespread social platform. By integrating an application successfully into Facebook's network, you can interact with all those users, which is a huge market and makes the game very accessible compared to client downloads.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5>Game Modes</h5>
        </p>

        <p>
            Tetris Friends put a bunch of game modes on the grid, and made them accessible to a lot of people very easily with their integration with Facebook.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sprint races players against other players to see who can clear the fastest 40 lines. Marathon is like limitless mode, but amplifies the speed and point progression a lot better than other game variants do. Battle 2P and 6P pits players against players in a refreshing take on the Tetris formula. These modes work heavily to improve the replayability of the game by switching up the skills required to succeed in each, and expand the skill sets of the players.
        </p>

        <p>
            But what game modes do is simply reward and spread player improvement equally. While Battle 2P is always the premier game mode, being good at any of the game modes automatically makes you better in other game modes, and this adds to the time spent in each mode. Get good at Sprint and suddenly you'll want to be as good in Batle 2P as you are in Sprint. Which brings me to my next point.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5>Rankings</h5>
        </p>

        <p>
            Basic Tetris has no metric on where your skill level stands. While you can judge a fair bit by saying, "Oh, I can't beat level 14", beyond these generic statements you have no information.
        </p>

        <p>
            By including this ranking solution, you can suddenly compare yourself to your friends: boast, cry, whatever. You have a standard, physical goal to work towards. You have a lot more concrete information to judge your own performance in that you're weak in sprints, but good at battles.
        </p>

        <p>
            My personal favourite element of their ranking system is that it makes you feel good.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you keep track of the labels they have defined for the ranking system, you will notice it is always positive. And this is amazing in keeping you interested. Do you want to be called a Hero or a noob? So instead of insults, we get all these Tetris Gods Grandmasters, Rock Stars and so on. It's amazing how they decided to keep the attitude positive like this, and how effective it is.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some people will argue that it hides information a lot more, but in reality, good players don't care about their label. They don't even care about the number. But improving or stalled players don't need to feel bad about being stuck at the Grandmaster level this way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Plus, the name obscures the fact that the skill level is dramatically higher at the top levels. An extremely interesting observation I found with Starcraft is that the professional gamers, the highest tier of players, are at a skill level way beyond even the top players. If you are familiar with the Starcraft 2 rankings, it goes <code class="in-line">Bronze &lt; Silver &lt; Gold &lt; Platinum &lt; Diamond &lt; Masters &lt; Grandmasters</code> where Grandmaster represents the top 200 players, and Masters represents the top 2% of the Diamond ranking. In this same example, you can easily see how someone in Diamond who is not award of Masters may think that he is one of the best players, and this makes him continue playing. I mean, Diamond sounds like it's a pretty high rank, no? The same thing applies in Tetris Friends.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img class="scale-with-grid" src="/images/tetrisranks.png"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Expert at level 13!
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5>Rewards</h5>
        </p>

        <p>
            And then adding rewards keep you coming back to the game. A really annoying, yet smart decision was to include a slot system where you opened more slots the more consecutive days you played. Diabolical yes. Smart yes. And running these slots more meant you got more Tetris money to spend for Tetris: adding skins, getting slight gaming tweaks.
            Rewards keep you coming back to play more.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tetris Friends just does so many things right, it's very easy to see how it has become so successful. However, it will need to continue to innovate and improve the user experience, because being a Tetris clone, there is definitely a limit to how many blocks casual gamers can handle stacking.

  I recently gained possession of a really nice pair of cables. 1/4" male to 1/4" male. Nothing 
  special really, except the cable feels really nice.
</p>




<p> 
  I have a pair of <a href="http://www.moon-audio.com/audio-cables/moon-audio-headphone-cables/moon-audio-blue-dragon-headphone-cable.html">Blue Dragon</a> cables from Moon-Audio. Apparently it's surrounded by Kevlar
  and Teflon tape. Yum. That link isn't the same pair, but it's close. It feels like a really high quality 
  braided cable. All newer Razer peripherals come braided with a <a href="http://cdn.theendearingdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Razer-Naga-Gaming-Mouse-Review14.jpg">cloth like material</a>. 
  It feels nice, but the Blue Dragon cable is less flexible, with a really strong and plasticky feel. 
  It feels amazing.
</p>




<p>
  My new cable feels even better. It's completely rubberized, which isn't something I've seen a lot.
  The rubber is really textured, unlike the smooth plasticky rubber on a lot of cables. It's 
  made by Fender, and says Professional Noiseless Cable on the cable itself. I don't know why that message is required. 
  Isn't that expected of every cable? 
</p>




<p>
  Oh well. It feels so nice I don't mind.

  When I first used Ubuntu, I fell in love with their
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workspace#Graphical_interfaces" target="_blank">workspaces</a>.
  The ability to open and manage multiple desktops very useful when you only have one monitor.
  The controls were intuitive, the transitions clean and delays non-existent.
  It was a good day.
</p>




<p>
  I later found out that Apple's OS X has the Expose and Spaces for their own version of workspaces.
  On my sister's MacBook, it is noticeably faster, more responsive and had more features, as expected on the very well
  designed Mac OS. As a Windows user primarily however, I felt very left out.
</p>




<p>
  After a lot of searching, I found the solution. <a href="http://dexpot.de/" target="_blank">Dexpot</a>
</p>




<p>
  They've made a lot of improvements since I've first time I used it, and right now, it's evolved into something
  beautiful. They've added much better taskbar integration, a less buggy multi-monitor support, and much, much better
  responsiveness overall. It's a great product with a great team behind it. I'm actually preferring Dexpot to
  Ubuntu's workspaces.
</p>




<p>
  The hotkeys are just more intuitive for one-handed productivity. Hardly anyone keeps both their hands on the keyboard unless they're
  working exclusively in the shell. Having one hand on the mouse is a lot more flexible. But Ubuntu requires a WIN+ARROW_KEY press
  to swap the workspace. A pretty big waste of time to move one hand over. Dexpot's solution? ALT+NUM. Simple and fast.
</p>




<p>
  Why use workspaces at all? The main benefit is clutter. Spacing out several applications over four screens is great,
  similar to the benefits of using multiple monitors. It means you can categorize your workspaces, one section for reference applications,
  one side for working programs, and another area for anything else. I actually use it on my dual monitor setup, and still find it useful.
  Having workspaces means keeping the programs maximized. Minimizing and maximizing requires a few more clicks, while with any virtual desktop
  application, pressing a customized key combination, say ALT+1 or
  WIN+DOWN_ARROW, will swap all the active applications to a new set (or carry some over depending on your preferences. It's much more convenient.
</p>




<p>
  The difference in productivity is pretty astounding. Give it a go <a href="http://dexpot.de/?id=download" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>




<p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We all have a finite number of keyboard presses in our lifetime, so we should do our best to increase the output of each press.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should try to do as much as we can with as little effort as we can manage, so we don't waste our valuable keypresses doing something that could've been done easier.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

  <a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> just saved me weeks of pain, so here it goes.
</p>




<p>
  If the Dropbox introduction video doesn't convince you, here is my real world use of Dropbox.
</p>




<p>
  I'm a University student that lives away from home. I decided to bring my desktop to my new residence. I also bought a new laptop so I could work outside of my residence.
</p>




<p>
  Here's the problem, all my files are out of sync. I can work on one of my essays after class in one of the many labs across campus. But once I get home, either I can only work on the essay on my laptop, or get a USB drive, move it to my desktop and work a bit. And if I want to work outside in one of the labs again? Save it to the USB, transfer it to my laptop and get going.
</p>




<p>
  While this is possible, it's just a massive waste of time compared to much better solutions. This is where Dropbox comes in.
</p>




<p>
  I use some slightly confusing system with GitHub and Dropbox, so
  I had to learn some new stuff so that I could upload my website properly to GitHub Pages.
  The first time I tried it, I actually deleted my website files, along with the
  GitHub repository. I had nothing to roll back to. It was all gone.
</p>




<p>
  But I was saved! Before this, I had always debated whether to put the website source files in my Dropbox folder, so I could
  work on it and sync my files across my computers, or if trying this system was a bit too complicated. Luckily for me, I left it on my Dropbox this time.
</p>




<p>
  When I accidentally deleted my website files, I panicked. But I found out that Dropbox saves a history of your deleted
  files, so that you can recover them if you're messed up accidentally, and actually use them as a mini-version
  tracker. Awesome for a free service. Thank you very much Dropbox, for saving a couple days' or weeks' worth of material.
  Kind of an amazing application.

  When people ask for motivation, it's really hard to give them a straight answer. 
  I never had one myself. But recently, I've had some really bad problems that 
  left me scratching my head. I couldn't solve it, and there was nothing I could do.
</p>




<p>
  But then I came along a couple of really good motivational posts, which really,
  in essence, told me to do it because failure is not an option. Mediocrity is not an option. 
  You don't have the time to be mediocre, because every second spent fixing your mediocrity
  is a second not spent getting ahead. 
</p>




<p>
  My motivation was always really,

  But as the time passed by, I began to realize that I grew into a habit of.. mediocrity. It might be because the education
  system doesn't really teach, and some life-changing realizations I've made since. 
  But I shouldn't be making excuses for my failures, because there isn't time in life to do this.

<p>
  I can't let one little thing, one little portion of my life, set me back so much of that time. Just as much as I can't do something
  50%, and then complain about it later on.

<p>
  Screw the motivation. Just do it.

  Sometimes, the oddest of circumstances makes you remember things you did in 
  the past, that somehow you forgot over the years. And most of the time, it puts a 
  really big smile on your face when you think about how simple times were.
</p>




<p> 
  I was having an innocent argument with an artist about stuff that we've made in the 
  past. While my friend is clearly the better artist between the two of us, I remembered
  that I really wanted to be a (graphic) artist at some point in my life.
</p>




<p>
  Since Grade 5 or 6, I have always been the biggest Counter-Strike fan, until some 
  tragic event a couple of years ago that forced me to quit. I played a lot of Counter-Strike, 
  so I'm pretty sure my 662 HOURS PLAYED on Steam is inaccurate. In my spare time then, 
  I thought about Counter-Strike a lot. Fiddled with the backend graphics; new scripts, new models,
  new decals. 
</p>




<p>
  My Grade 9 Art mark was an astounding 100, a surprise, even to myself. I think my 
  Art teacher had a lot of hope in me, and was probably a little heartbroken when me 
  and my friend (who also got 100), decided not to take Grade 10 Art.
</p>




<p>
  I had before stumbled upon a thriving online game modding community in 
  <a href="http://www.fpsbanana.com" target="_blank">FPSBanana</a>. I was hooked.
  I vividly remember seeing <a href="http://gamebanana.com/members/164481" target="_blank">Teh Snake</a>.
  He made many brilliant and amazing mods, and quite possibly the reason I wanted to go into graphic design.
</p>




<p>
  Eventually, I tried my hand at modding, and upon realizing I hadn't the talent or the experience,
  I tried something much, much easier, and something that brings me a little bit of joy to see online now.
</p>




<p>
  I made a custom hand skin for Counter-Strike after collaborating a bit with the original owner, Nasaratsu.
  Here's the <a href="http://gamebanana.com/cscz/skins/48319" target="_blank">link</a>, and while it's 
  really bad, I'm still extremely proud of it. Over 6,000 downloads, and 14,000 views. :')

    I had an interview the other day that really shook me up.

    He asked me a question that really made me wonder how much I really knew about programming. 
    I really thought I knew Python (at least somewhat decently), but I understand now there's a difference between using a language a few times, and actually knowing the language in and out.

    My answer was... "crap." I did not know what to do really, and it cost me the interview. I was ashamed, and now that I try it, I should've known it. 

    The question was (I think):

    Wow. Just wow. I don't know how I made it this far programming if that was the best I could 
    come up with. Honest.

    Easily handles any issue with spacing when you remove the word with one letter.

    The output should be 
</p>




<p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;df as o&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

</p>




<p>
    I'd like to think I made progress, but this could be done a lot better still. 
    But if I got this far in 3 months, I'm can't think of the possibilities in a couple years!
