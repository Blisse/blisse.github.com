    <p>
  A little change of tone from my usually more laid back posts.
</p><p>
  When people ask for motivation, it's really hard to give them a straight answer. 
  I never had one myself. But recently, I've had some really horrid problems that 
  left me scratching my head. I couldn't solve it, and there was nothing I could do.
</p><p>
  But then I came along a couple of really good motivational posts, which really,
  in essence, told me to do it because failure is not an option. Mediocrity is not an option.
</p><p>
  And that's what I've always believed in. My motivation was always really, 
  "Do it because you can. Do it to prove to yourself that you can. 
  Do it 100% because when it's all over, you're still an insignificant speck,
  unless your 100% is better than his." 
</p><p>
  Talk about an inferiority complex going on here.
</p><p>
  But I realized, I grew into a habit of accepting mediocrity. It might be because the university 
  system forces this down our throats a bunch, and some life-changing realizations I've made since 
  expanding my horizons. And it may be, just because. 
</p><p>
  I shouldn't be making excuses for my failures, because there isn't time in life to do this.
</p><p>
  60sec * 60min * 24hr * 365.25days * 100 yrs = NOT ENOUGH
</p><p>
  Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. And there goes so much precious time. Not enough time to sit back and 
  let something like, motivation, run your life. Do it because you can, and because you want to 
  be the best at it. 
</p><p>
  Screw motivation. Just go for it.
</p>

    <p>
  Sometimes, the oddest of circumstances makes you remember things you did in 
  the past, that somehow you forgot over the years. And most of the time, it puts a 
  really big smile on your face when you remember.
</p><p> 
  I was having an innocent argument with an artist about stuff that we've made in the 
  past. While my friend is clearly the better artist between the two of us, I remembered
  that I really wanted to be a (graphic) artist at some point in my life. 
</p><p>
  My Grade 9 Art mark was an astounding 100, a surprise, even to myself. I think my 
  Art teacher had a lot of hope in me, and was probably a little heartbroken when me 
  and my friend (who also got 100), decided not to take Grade 10 Art.
</p><p>
  Since Grade 5 or 6, I have always been the biggest Counter-Strike fan, until some 
  tragic event a couple of years ago that forced me to quit. I played a lot of Counter-Strike, 
  so I'm pretty sure my 662 HOURS PLAYED on Steam is inaccurate. In my spare time then, 
  I thought about Counter-Strike a lot. But that's for another time.
</p><p>
  One day, I stumbled upon a thriving online game modding community in 
  <a href='http://www.fpsbanana.com' target='_blank'>FPSBanana</a>. Immediately I was hooked. 
  The most memorable member was <a href='http://gamebanana.com/members/164481' target='_blank'>Teh Snake</a>.
  He made so many brilliant and amazing mods, he really was the reason I wanted to go into graphic design.
</p><p>
  Eventually, I tried my hand at modding, and upon realizing I had no talent,
  I tried something much, much easier, and something that brings me joy to see online to this very day.
</p><p>
  I made a custom hand skin for CS1.6 and CZ after collaborating with the original owner, Nasaratsu.
  Here's the <a href='http://gamebanana.com/cscz/skins/48319' target='_blank'>link</a>, and while it's 
  really bad, I'm still extremely proud of it. Over 6,000 downloads, and 14,000 views. :')

    <h3><a href="/2012/04/14/failinterview/" rel="bookmark permalink" title="Permanent link to this post">failed interview</a></h3>

    <p>I had an interview the other day that really shook me up.</p>

<p>He asked me a question that really made me wonder how much I really knew about programming. I really thought I knew Python (at least somewhat decently), but I understand now there&#8217;s a difference between using a language a few times, and actually knowing the language in and out.</p>

<p>My answer was&#8230; &#8220;crap.&#8221; I did not know what to do really, and it cost me the interview. I was ashamed, and now that I try it, I should&#8217;ve known it.</p>

<p>The question was (I think):</p>

<p>Easily handles any issue with spacing when you remove the word with one letter.</p>

<p>The output should be</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='gp'>&gt;</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;df as o&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think I made progress, but this could be done a lot better still. But if I got this far in 3 months, I&#8217;m can&#8217;t think of the possibilities in a couple years!</p>
