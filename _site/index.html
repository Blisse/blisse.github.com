		<h3><a href="/archive/2012/08/11/index.html" rel="bookmark permalink" title="Permanent link to this post">some cables feel really nice</a> /20120811</h3>

		<p>
  I recently gained possession of a really nice pair of cables. 1/4" male to 1/4" male. Nothing 
  special really, except the cable feels really nice.
</p><p> 
  I have a pair of <a href='http://www.moon-audio.com/audio-cables/moon-audio-headphone-cables/moon-audio-blue-dragon-headphone-cable.html'>Blue Dragon</a> cables from Moon-Audio. Apparently it's surrounded by Kevlar
  and Teflon tape. Yum. That link isn't the same pair, but it's close. It feels like a really high quality 
  braided cable. All newer Razer peripherals come braided with a <a href='http://cdn.theendearingdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Razer-Naga-Gaming-Mouse-Review14.jpg'>cloth like material</a>. 
  It feels nice, but the Blue Dragon cable is less flexible, with a really strong and plasticky feel. 
  It feels amazing.
</p><p>
  My new cable feels even better. It's completely rubberized, which isn't something I've seen a lot.
  The rubber is really textured, unlike the smooth plasticky rubber on a lot of cables. It's 
  made by Fender, and says Professional Noiseless Cable on the cable itself. I don't know why that required
  any notification. Isn't that expected of every cable? Oh well. It feels so nice I don't mind.

		<p>
  When I first used Ubuntu, I fell in love with graphical 
  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workspace#Graphical_interfaces' target='_blank'>workspaces</a>.
  The ability to open and manage multiple desktops was a great implementation when you only have one monitor. 
  The controls were intuitive, the  transitions were clean and delays were non-existent. 
  It was an amazing discovery.
</p><p>
  I later found out that Apple's OS X has the Expose and Spaces for their own version of workspaces. 
  It is noticeably faster, more responsive and applied better features, as expected on the very well 
  designed Mac OS. As a Windows user primarily however, I felt very left out.
</p><p>
  After a lot of searching, I found the solution. <a href='http://dexpot.de/' target='_blank'>Dexpot</a>
</p><p>
  They've made a lot of improvements since I've first time I used it, and right now, it's evolved into something
  beautiful. They've added much better taskbar integration, a less buggy multi-monitor support, and much, much better 
  responsiveness overall. It's a great product with a great team behind it.
</p><p>
  Simply put, virtual desktops allow one to swap between screens. 
</p><p>
  The main benefit is clutter. Spacing out several applications over four screens is great, similar to the benefits
  of using multiple monitors. It means you can categorize your workspaces, one section for reference applications, 
  one side for working programs, and another area for anything else.
</p><p>
  Keeping the programs maximized like this means the program is almost always active. Minimizing and maximizing is 
  a drag, while with Dexpot or any virtual desktop application, pressing a customized key combination, say ALT+1 or 
  ALT+2, will swap the active applications to a new set. It's much more convenient.
</p><p>
  The difference in productivity is pretty astounding. Give it a go <a href='http://dexpot.de/?id=download' target='_blank'>here</a>.

  It is ridiculous how hard it is to rework an entire website. Currently, the site is pretty bad
  for mobile, plus it doesn't act the way I want it when the window is resized. I plan to fix that.
</p><p>
  Meanwhile, expect a lot more breaking in the future.

		<h3><a href="/archive/2012/07/26/index.html" rel="bookmark permalink" title="Permanent link to this post">saved by dropbox</a> /20120726</h3>

		<p>
  I love <a href='http://www.dropbox.com' target='_blank'>Dropbox</a>.
</p><p>
  Because I use some slightly more complicated system with GitHub and Dropbox, 
  I had to learn some new stuff so that I could upload my website properly to GitHub Pages.
  The first time I tried it, I actually deleted my website files, along with the 
  GitHub repository. I had nothing to roll back to. It was all gone.
</p><p>
  But to my joy, I always debated whether to put the website source in my Dropbox, so I could
  work on it and sync my files across my computers. So I left it on my Dropbox this time.
</p><p>
  When I accidentally deleted my website files, I found out that Dropbox saves a history of your deleted
  files, so that you can recover them if they go accidentally, and actually use them as a mini-version
  tracker. Awesome for a free service.
</p><p>
  Thank you very much Dropbox, for saving a couple days' or weeks' worth of material. Thank you.

		<p>
  When people ask for motivation, it's really hard to give them a straight answer. 
  I never had one myself. But recently, I've had some really bad problems that 
  left me scratching my head. I couldn't solve it, and there was nothing I could do.
</p><p>
  But then I came along a couple of really good motivational posts, which really,
  in essence, told me to do it because failure is not an option. Mediocrity is not an option.
</p><p>
  And that's what I've always believed in. My motivation was always really, 
  "Do it because you can. Do it to prove to yourself that you can. 
  Do it 100% because when it's all over, you're still an insignificant speck,
  unless your 100% is better than his." Talk about an inferiority complex going on here.
</p><p>
  But I realized, I grew into a habit of accepting mediocrity. It might be because the university 
  system forces this down our throats a bunch, and some life-changing realizations I've made since. 
  I shouldn't be making excuses for my failures, because there isn't time in life to do this.
</p><p>
  
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>60sec * 60min * 24hr * 365.25days * 100 yrs = 3,155,760,000 seconds. Not enough.</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

</p><p>
  I can't let one little thing set me back so much of that time. Just as much as I can't do something
  50%, and then complain about it later on.
</p><p>
  Screw getting the motivation. I'll just do it.
</p><p>
	<a href='http://youtu.be/Sk56VxaeqEQ' target='_blank'>The BEST Motivation</a>
</p><p>
  "You need to ask yourself, 'what are you going to do today,' <br />
  but more importantly, 'how are you going to do it.'"
