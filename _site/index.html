		<h3><a href="/archive/2012/09/15/index.html" >gaming professionalism</a> //20120915</h3>

		<p>
  I really like gaming. There is something beautiful about immersing yourself completely in the game.
  Losing yourself completely in this reality, and escaping the physical world. It is the same feeling I 
  try to get to when I'm listening to music. Bliss.
</p><p>
  Lately, I've been following the emerging e-sports scene; gamers pushing towards making gaming a sport, 
  a thriving, sustainable industry with actual careers. The main game responsible? StarCraft.
</p><p>
  For the last 14 years, StarCraft and StarCraft:Brood War (I will refer to both as just BW), has been a huge 
  commercial success. But only in South Korea, where the best progamers compete in packed stadiums in front of
  screaming Korean fangirls, for huge grand prizes and honour, in two competitive proleagues, with top
  salaries in the 100K's. That's just, ridiculous to think about, but it's happened.
</p><p>
  But this success was not met across the globe. While the Korean community thrived, the Western community was much 
  more recluse. StarCraft wasn't as big; actually, Counter-Strike was the thing. But there were many strong contenders
  underground, who moved to Korea to train with the best. The Western scene was okay, but left much to be desired
  for the players.
</p><p>
  With the launch of StarCraft 2 (SC2), Blizzard, the developers, decided to take the huge success of BW and expand it across 
  the globe; the push for e-sports began. 2 years later, it's really obvious how much of an impact this has had. 
  Competitive gaming has become mainstream. Popularized by League of Legends, Defense of the Ancients 1 and 2, 
  Heroes of Newerth, Call of Duty, Halo, and StarCraft 2, gamers across the globe have ridiculously easier access to these games.
  It's easy to talk to a few friends about what's going on in the competitive scene, participate in some fantasy leagues, and even
  attend live events. 
</p><p>
  So what's missing for the Western world? Taking a look at Korean BW, and European Counter-Strike, you can see
  something that's really surprising. Gamers, and the people around them, are surprisingly professional. Not only 
  in actions, but appearance. Most people still have the idea that gaming is only for 'nerds'. And currently, it's hard
  to disagree with them. While the competitive scenes have a fair share of exceptions, they are still the exception. 
  It is difficult for the mainstream society to enjoy watching a scrawny, freckled teenager with mismatched clothes win 
  several thousand dollars, as bad as that sounds. Western society has this huge emphasis on appearance that many gamers lack.
</p><p>
  However, it doesn't have to be that way. <a href='http://youtu.be/VWOIgB37LKQ' target='_blank'>This</a> is SK|HeatoN, who was
  part of a very successful Counter-Strike team. And he looks and acts perfectly. If you watch Korean BW on television (yes, this exists),
  you'll see the commentators are exactly like that as well. Casual, yet professional. Same with the players, respectful and professional.
  Some of the players have even modeled. Image sells.
</p><p>
  While it's really enticing to have a thriving competitive scene where everyone is judgment-free and accepting of the geeky
  and nerdy tendencies of many gamers, it's important to the mainstream (and the sponsors) that there is some sort of 
  professional image put forth. That there is some sort of general concensus for gamers to realize this can be your career, your life's work,
  and take their gaming seriously. Because if you treat video games as only video games, how are you going to convince someone it's also 
  a sport and your career?

		<h3><a href="/archive/2012/09/08/index.html" >coders' block</a> //20120908</h3>

		<p>
  I'm working on my Poker game, and it's always the same story.
</p><p>
  I always find that the hardest part is not the logic, but getting it playable. 
  I seem to always be torn between optimizing now so that I don't write horrible 
  code for future me to debug, and just getting it down. It's starting to get really annoying. 
  It's like some form of writer's block; for programmers. There's just so much I want to do
  and so little time to do it, I'm stuck deciding what to do instead of just going for it.
</p><p>
  I think my best plan of attack is to just make it playable as soon 
  as possible. I don't think I should worry about optimizing now, even if it means 
  I'll have a harder job in the future. Hey, it'd be good experience to weed through really,
  really bad code.

  I'm not really a fan of how my css theme is at the moment, so here comes a complete

		<h3><a href="/archive/2012/08/20/index.html" >tetris basics</a> //20120820</h3>

		<div class='sixteen columns'>
<p>
  I don't know who said it, but it's true. If you want to get better, more often than not you'll have to do worse.
</p>

<p>
  The exact reason? People are bad. A pretty pessimistic view, but completely justified. Since our birth, we're are
  bombarded with a lot of information, especially so in this day and age. And it's our job to filter out what's good and
  what's bad. However, sometimes before we realize it, we'll have made this decision unconsciously. Perhaps you played a game for 
  a long time without a good strategy guide. Or perhaps you learned math one way instead of another. 
</p>

<p>
  Then you've used this 'bad style' for 5-10 years, and it's so ingrained into your being that you don't even think about why
  you do it this way and what other ways there are. When you realize you've been doing it wrong the entire time, it takes a 
  tremendous amount of effort to break your old habits and rewire that muscle memory. 
</p>

<p>
  So when you are able to see directly where you want to go <b>right</b> from the beginning, and visualize the route you're going to take, and
  actually have that happening to you, it gives you a huge advantage over others. At least, it gave me a big advantage.
</p>

<p>
  It's not to say people were getting the basics wrong. Nope. If we didn't have the advantage of the Internet, and more importantly,
  information, what normal people would do just seems right. But the innovators didn't only do that. They kept their eyes open. 
  They noticed the implications, the limits and weaknesses of each style, and kept questioning all their decisions. A revolutionary 
  way of thinking. 
</p>

<p>
  The new generation only play in a single line style. And some get really good with it. But they've been tunnel-visioned into this style.
  They're not open to new ideas, and they don't have the experience of swapping styles and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.
  At low to mid levels of Tetris, combo-ing is the most effective way to play, yet most players don't realize this because they only play
  their one line style. For fun, that's fine. To get good? We'll need something else.
</p>

  These are examples of the styles. The standard Tetris grid is 10x20(+2), 10 horizontal. In one-line, one space is left empty and you
  build upwards from there. In two-line, two spaces are left empty, and so on. The two-line style is the easiest to play, and easily beats the one-line 
  if you play at the same level. Why? Like I said, combo-ing is the best way to begin, and the two-line is almost a guaranteed combo chain everytime you start.
  Why? Well if you took the time to think about it a bit, it'd make perfect sense. Every single Tetris piece except the I-piece will continue a combo
  if you drop it in the 2-block wide hole because every block except the I-piece has a width of 2 somewhere.
</p>

<p>
  The next thing you'll notice is then how high combos are devastating, so you'll want as high a combo as possible. To get that, you'll find it's best to only clear
  one line when you're combo-ing. Done well enough, you can possibly have a 13-14 consecutive combo, which is very, very strong.
</p>

<p>
  Playing well doesn't mean you'll perform well however. A large component of improving in Tetris is consistency. There is almost zero room for mistakes.
  If you do make a mistake, you need to have the foresight to minimize its effects, and fix it, because it is very costly to the consecutive combo-ing if you
  aren't careful. Multiple mistakes, and you can probably forfeit the game already if you're playing against very high levels. Consistency requires stamina, of course, 
  and you'll notice as you play more, your performance will degrade at times. It's important to take frequent breaks, and eventually you'll notice you can play for 2 hours 
  without a severe performance degradation. 
</p>

<p>
  Consistency throughout multiple games is important, but also consistency throughout every single game. Play the beginning exactly like how you would play out the
  ending. Calmly and quickly. If you play the entire match at <span class='italics'>your</span> pace, you won't lose simply because you messed up once. Every portion of 
  your game will be dangerous. I have been down 2 or 3 KOs multiple times right at the start of the game, but because my pace is very strong, I can came back and win, 
  simply because I'm playing this strong, fast pace that allows me to not make mistakes, yet not sacrifice attacking potential.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually you can reach a point where building up your stack is almost done by reflex, and you will notice you have a lot more eye freedom to stare at your opponent's game
  and <span class='italics'>predict</span> what he'll do, and then play your own side in anticipation. This is a very strong strategy, and combined with a strong foundation
  will push you further up. And because you have such a strong foundation already, adding things like prediction or ending strongly will have much more visible effects.
