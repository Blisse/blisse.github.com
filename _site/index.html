		<h3><a href="/archive/2012/09/18/index.html" >professionalism in esports</a> /20120918</h3>

		<p>
	I'm a big fan of the electronic sports (e-sports) movement. For the last 10 years, gamers have been pushing the idea
	that gaming isn't that different from soccer or basketball. People who play at an extremely high level, the "professionals", 
	deserve a chance to make playing the game a job rather than just a hobby. And it's working.
</p><p>
	Really it sounds ridiculous, but in Korea, the game Starcraft has over the last 10 years really ingrained itself in 
	the Korean consciousness. Progamers, as they're called, compete in televised live events, with the top tier earning easily 100K USD,
	and cheered on by mobs of fans, male and female alike. Yes, these are gamers. 
</p><p>
	StarCraft 2, the sequel to the iconic StarCraft and Starcraft: Brood War hopes to emulate this success, but now heavily
	involving the Western audience. Korea was the place to be for StarCraft. The Koreans dominated completely, and they still do in 
	the sequel. The only difference is that now, they're much more open to the Western competitors, and it's not as one-sided as before.
</p><p>
	Many, many people really want e-sports to kick off for the West. Hours spent gaming overnight could actually be a productive use of time, 
	and a promising career. It's a very enviable vision, but it is really hindered by the immature nature of gaming. 
</p><p>
	Gaming involves, for a large part, having fun. At the highest levels, it doesn't become fun anymore after the 12 hour daily training regime.
	But for the general Western audience, which already has a low maturity level, the fun is really evident. The commentators for the games who 
	call out the shots not only look shabby much of the time, but talk casually. The players are immature and the scene is rife with controversy.
	Hardly the environment for a sport to thrive.
</p><p>
	The difference? The layer of professionalism that all sports uphold.
</p><p>
	Commentators do not snigger at the players. They do not obviously favour one side. They do not introduce their pets or their hobbies.
	Players speak sufficient English. They dress well and handle themselves with care. Image matters, even if some would convince themselves otherwise.
</p><p>
	Counter-Strike was really the West's copy of StarCraft, on a much much lower scale. Many names are very recognizable to followers, and 
	many top gamers were involved in the game or with sponsors even after retiring. The difference? They look the part.
</p><p> 
	<a href='http://youtu.be/VWOIgB37LKQ' target='_blank'>Here</a> is a nice video of one of the greatest Counter-Strike players, Heaton.
	While he is undoubtedbly a great gamer, he also looks like a strong role model. <a href='http://white-ra.com/' target='_blank'>White-Ra</a> is a 
	great representative of this attitude for StarCraft, highly contrasting from the high profile but more controversial Western figures. He is always 
	polite, always looks after himself, and always professional. Amazing guy really.
</p><p>
	And if StarCraft wants to persist, they'll do much better to have people like White-Ra as role models and leaders, because even now, the typical 
	gamer is still seen as overweight/underweight, disheveled and immature.

		<h3><a href="/archive/2012/09/08/index.html" >coding from scratch</a> /20120908</h3>

		<p>
  I'm working on my Poker game, and it's always the same story.
</p><p>
  I always find that the hardest part is not the logic, but getting down a 
  workable and playable structure. I seem to always be torn between optimizing 
  now so that I don't write horrible code for future me and just getting it down, so
  it's starting to get really stiffling.
</p><p>
  I guess my best plan of attack is to just brain storm the entire process out by hand
  so I can visual the pieces that I need to put in place, and then implement that as soon
  as possible. I don't think I really need to worry about optimizing now, even if it means 
  I'll have a harder job in the future. Hey, it'd be good experience.

  I'm not really a fan of how my css theme is at the moment, so here comes a complete
  rework of my CSS. Hopefully this won't take too long, but haven't had much time recently. 
  Here goes nothing!

		<h3><a href="/archive/2012/08/20/index.html" >how tetris battle works - the style</a> /20120820</h3>

		<p>
  To get better, you must get worse. That's very true if you've started off in a bad style, and need to move to another one. 
  No one is immediately amazing at every new thing they try, so don't be discouraged. You must also keep an open mind to your style
  so that you can recognize the implications of playing how you play. 
</p><p>
  I'll point out the most common idea that should come up. Last part, I mentioned that people only know one way to play. People in that mindset
  don't want to get out of it because "it's hard," or "I don't like the way it feels." Thus they allow themselves to settle for a sub-standard style.
  Fine for casual gaming, not fine for improvement. Often, they don't realize the simple fact that comboing consecutively is a lot better than
  a Tetris or back-to-back Tetris. That's a realization most players make when they transition out of it.
</p><p>
  Only from that point do you realize that if you can maximize the effectiveness of each piece during a combo, you'll fare much better off. 
  And that's how you realize what's possible moving forward. 
</p><p>
  The 2-line style is the best style to improve, I think. Playing this well will get you from 10-60 easily. The beauty lies in the 2 block empty spaces.
  When you throw your pieces in there, every piece is guaranteed to make at least one line, bar the I-piece. This means 7 combos are now available at the minimum,
  and when you play more, even 13 combos are a possibility when you add in bomb clearing.
</p><p>
  In Tetris, you definitely do not want to make mistakes. A single mistake can throw off your game. Two mistakes in a row 
  will crush you when you're at higher levels. So it's a good idea to start learning proper technique. Lots of players focus on speed
  and speed alone. When they get near to the end of the match, all of that goes to hell. Concentration breaks and mistakes happen.
  What potentially could've been another 10-20 lines sent all ends because they made one mistake that may have cost them the break.
  What's the most important rule then? Pacing. 
</p><p>
  You need to play at a consistently good pace the entire game. That way, your entire game stabilizes, and you won't lose simply because
  you messed up once. I've been in many situations where my opponent gets 2 points ahead because they anticipated my moves, but then they can't 
  keep up a solid style and I end up winning 3-2, simply because I'm playing to not make mistakes, not for attacking opportunities.
</p><p>
  Once you reach a level where you can build up carelessly, then you can take quick peeks at your opponent's stack, and with that stack, peek at their
  incoming pieces. This is when those other pillars start to join in. You want to develop your core game, then add these little boosts. And because you 
  have such a strong core, it's super easy to incorporate it, and you'll reap the benefits much better.
