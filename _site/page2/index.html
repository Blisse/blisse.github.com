<p>
  I don't know who said it, but it's true. If you want to get better, more often than not you'll have to do worse.
</p>

<p>
  The exact reason? People are bad. A pretty pessimistic view, but completely justified. Since our birth, we're are
  bombarded with a lot of information, especially so in this day and age. And it's our job to filter out what's good and
  what's bad. However, sometimes before we realize it, we'll have made this decision unconsciously. Perhaps you played a game for 
  a long time without a good strategy guide. Or perhaps you learned math one way instead of another. 
</p>

<p>
  Then you've used this 'bad style' for 5-10 years, and it's so ingrained into your being that you don't even think about why
  you do it this way and what other ways there are. When you realize you've been doing it wrong the entire time, it takes a 
  tremendous amount of effort to break your old habits and rewire that muscle memory. 
</p>

<p>
  So when you are able to see directly where you want to go <b>right</b> from the beginning, and visualize the route you're going to take, and
  actually have that happening to you, it gives you a huge advantage over others. At least, it gave me a big advantage.
</p>

<p>
  It's not to say people were getting the basics wrong. Nope. If we didn't have the advantage of the Internet, and more importantly,
  information, what normal people would do just seems right. But the innovators didn't only do that. They kept their eyes open. 
  They noticed the implications, the limits and weaknesses of each style, and kept questioning all their decisions. A revolutionary 
  way of thinking. 
</p>

<p>
  The new generation only play in a single line style. And some get really good with it. But they've been tunnel-visioned into this style.
  They're not open to new ideas, and they don't have the experience of swapping styles and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.
  At low to mid levels of Tetris, combo-ing is the most effective way to play, yet most players don't realize this because they only play
  their one line style. For fun, that's fine. To get good? We'll need something else.

  These are examples of the styles. The standard Tetris grid is 10x20(+2), 10 horizontal. In one-line, one space is left empty and you
  build upwards from there. In two-line, two spaces are left empty, and so on. The two-line style is the easiest to play, and easily beats the one-line 
  if you play at the same level. Why? Like I said, combo-ing is the best way to begin, and the two-line is almost a guaranteed combo chain everytime you start.
  Why? Well if you took the time to think about it a bit, it'd make perfect sense. Every single Tetris piece except the I-piece will continue a combo
  if you drop it in the 2-block wide hole because every block except the I-piece has a width of 2 somewhere.
</p>

<p>
  The next thing you'll notice is then how high combos are devastating, so you'll want as high a combo as possible. To get that, you'll find it's best to only clear
  one line when you're combo-ing. Done well enough, you can possibly have a 13-14 consecutive combo, which is very, very strong.
</p>

<p>
  Playing well doesn't mean you'll perform well however. A large component of improving in Tetris is consistency. There is almost zero room for mistakes.
  If you do make a mistake, you need to have the foresight to minimize its effects, and fix it, because it is very costly to the consecutive combo-ing if you
  aren't careful. Multiple mistakes, and you can probably forfeit the game already if you're playing against very high levels. Consistency requires stamina, of course, 
  and you'll notice as you play more, your performance will degrade at times. It's important to take frequent breaks, and eventually you'll notice you can play for 2 hours 
  without a severe performance degradation. 
</p>

<p>
  Consistency throughout multiple games is important, but also consistency throughout every single game. Play the beginning exactly like how you would play out the
  ending. Calmly and quickly. If you play the entire match at <span class='italics'>your</span> pace, you won't lose simply because you messed up once. Every portion of 
  your game will be dangerous. I have been down 2 or 3 KOs multiple times right at the start of the game, but because my pace is very strong, I can came back and win, 
  simply because I'm playing this strong, fast pace that allows me to not make mistakes, yet not sacrifice attacking potential.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually you can reach a point where building up your stack is almost done by reflex, and you will notice you have a lot more eye freedom to stare at your opponent's game
  and <span class='italics'>predict</span> what he'll do, and then play your own side in anticipation. This is a very strong strategy, and combined with a strong foundation
  will push you further up. And because you have such a strong foundation already, adding things like prediction or ending strongly will have much more visible effects.

		<h2><a href="/archive/2012/08/19/index.html" >tetris friends</a> //20120819</h2>

		<p>
  I recently got to level 95 in Tetris Friends Battle 2P and 6P, so here's some Tetris. ^^
</p><p>
  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris'>Tetris</a> is somewhat of a famous game. Most people who've played it probably first
  started on the GameBoy. Maybe something like this.
</p><div class='center'>
<img alt='ye olde Tetris' src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/GB_Tetris.png' />
</div><p>
  Nowadays, <a href='http://www.tetrisfriends.com/' target='_blank'>Tetris Friends</a> is all the rage. 
  And for good reason.
</p><p>
  They have a monopoly on the casual Tetris scene, being the exclusive licensee of Tetris in North America and Europe. They have a dedicated site and a much better app on Facebook. 
  Actually, it probably wouldn't be very wrong to say that Tetris Friends is the reason Tetris has experienced a recent resurgence.
</p><p>
  The Tetris Friends has several game modes in both Single Player and Multiplayer. Marathon, where you try to clear as many lines as possible,
  to Sprint 5P, where you play 3 others to finish 40 lines in the fastest time, to Battle 2P, where you battle another player and score KOs. 
  It's really addicting, smooth, and in general just very fun to play. 
</p><p>
  My main experience is with the Multiplayer Battle 2P and 6P modes, so that's where I'll start.
</p><h4 class='subheader'>My History</h4><p>
  In May, one of my high school friends saw me playing Tetris, and asked me for a match. I hadn't seen him in a while, so why not.
  In short, he crushed me. Long version? He REALLY crushed me. I actually thought I was decent. He was Level 100, literally a Tetris God.
  I vowed that day to get to a point where I could compete toe-to-toe with him. At least, somewhere toe-to-toe. It was a game, and it was a 
  fun challenge. My favourite kind.
</p><p>
  Over the last 3 months, I played Tetris Friends pretty ritually. After work, a couple hours. On the weekends, a couple hours. Nothing too crazy,
  but it got me really into the game, and to a point where I could starting seeing a vast improvement over my newbie self from May. It was very rewarding to see
  this effort and determination turning into something real. Yay!
</p><p>
  Battle 2P is the most competitive game mode. You play another player from around the world,
  send as many lines as possible to the other player, and hope you KO them more than they do to you. To send lines, you'll have to perform combos. 
  Along the way, you'll also have to clear the lines that your opponent sends to you by clearing the bombs away. It's complicated,
  but play a few times and you'll get the gist of it. Here's a image I found off Google off a couple of newer players going at it.
</p><div class='center'>
<img alt='Tetris Battle' class='scale-with-grid child-padding' src='http://i.ytimg.com/vi/AHdBNRff2AY/0.jpg' />
</div><p> 
  Starting off, I was pretty bad, but I knew how to improve, and I set about playing only for that purpose.
  Knowing how to improve was really important. There's a lot of players that are really amazing at some parts of the game, but say, play a bad style, and that hinders
  their improvement. There isn't really an exact skill ceiling for this game since you can play at blistering speeds. But having a bad strategy will harm your development
  in the long run. I was fortunate enough to be able to visualize this kind of improvement plan for myself, and able to watch it unfold.
</p><p>
  Most players in the game know of only one way to play. I will refer to this as the 1-line style. Since the game board is 10 spaces across, they'll fill up
  9 of those spaces as high as possible, leaving 1 space at the left or right side, while saving up the I-piece, then drop it once for 
  a Tetris, and again for a Back-to-Back Tetris. This is pretty good for low levels, and solid enough to help develop your building skills. 
  But definitely, it's the worst way to play.
</p><p>
  I will save the strategic discussions my next post. And later I'll try to pinpoint in a later exactly why Tetris Friends is so good. From a development point of view of course.

		<h2><a href="/archive/2012/08/11/index.html" >some cables feel really nice</a> //20120811</h2>

		<p>
  I recently gained possession of a really nice pair of cables. 1/4" male to 1/4" male. Nothing 
  special really, except the cable feels really nice.
</p><p> 
  I have a pair of <a href='http://www.moon-audio.com/audio-cables/moon-audio-headphone-cables/moon-audio-blue-dragon-headphone-cable.html'>Blue Dragon</a> cables from Moon-Audio. Apparently it's surrounded by Kevlar
  and Teflon tape. Yum. That link isn't the same pair, but it's close. It feels like a really high quality 
  braided cable. All newer Razer peripherals come braided with a <a href='http://cdn.theendearingdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Razer-Naga-Gaming-Mouse-Review14.jpg'>cloth like material</a>. 
  It feels nice, but the Blue Dragon cable is less flexible, with a really strong and plasticky feel. 
  It feels amazing.
</p><p>
  My new cable feels even better. It's completely rubberized, which isn't something I've seen a lot.
  The rubber is really textured, unlike the smooth plasticky rubber on a lot of cables. It's 
  made by Fender, and says Professional Noiseless Cable on the cable itself. I don't know why that message is required. 
  Isn't that expected of every cable? 
</p><p>
  Oh well. It feels so nice I don't mind.

		<h2><a href="/archive/2012/08/03/index.html" >dexpot</a> //20120803</h2>

		<p>
  When I first used Ubuntu, I fell in love with their 
  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workspace#Graphical_interfaces' target='_blank'>workspaces</a>.
  The ability to open and manage multiple desktops very useful when you only have one monitor. 
  The controls were intuitive, the transitions clean and delays non-existent. 
  It was a good day.
</p><p>
  I later found out that Apple's OS X has the Expose and Spaces for their own version of workspaces. 
  On my sister's MacBook, it is noticeably faster, more responsive and had more features, as expected on the very well 
  designed Mac OS. As a Windows user primarily however, I felt very left out.
</p><p>
  After a lot of searching, I found the solution. <a href='http://dexpot.de/' target='_blank'>Dexpot</a>
</p><p>
  They've made a lot of improvements since I've first time I used it, and right now, it's evolved into something
  beautiful. They've added much better taskbar integration, a less buggy multi-monitor support, and much, much better 
  responsiveness overall. It's a great product with a great team behind it. I'm actually preferring Dexpot to 
  Ubuntu's workspaces.
</p><p>
  The hotkeys are just more intuitive for one-handed productivity. Hardly anyone keeps both their hands on the keyboard unless they're 
  working exclusively in the shell. Having one hand on the mouse is a lot more flexible. But Ubuntu requires a WIN+ARROW_KEY press 
  to swap the workspace. A pretty big waste of time to move one hand over. Dexpot's solution? ALT+NUM. Simple and fast.
</p><p>
  Why use workspaces at all? The main benefit is clutter. Spacing out several applications over four screens is great, 
  similar to the benefits of using multiple monitors. It means you can categorize your workspaces, one section for reference applications, 
  one side for working programs, and another area for anything else. I actually use it on my dual monitor setup, and still find it useful.
  Having workspaces means keeping the programs maximized. Minimizing and maximizing requires a few more clicks, while with any virtual desktop 
  application, pressing a customized key combination, say ALT+1 or 
  WIN+DOWN_ARROW, will swap all the active applications to a new set (or carry some over depending on your preferences. It's much more convenient.
</p><p>
  The difference in productivity is pretty astounding. Give it a go <a href='http://dexpot.de/?id=download' target='_blank'>here</a>.
</p><p>
  <blockquote>
	Everyone agrees, humans have a finite number of key and mouse presses. As programmers, we want to maximize the productivity and number of presses
	we have. When we constantly move our hand from the keyboard to the mouse, the time waste inbetween eventually becomes a big deal. That's why 
	we use workspaces. <cite>me</cite>

  It is ridiculous how hard it is to rework an entire website. Currently, the site is pretty bad
  for mobile, plus it doesn't act the way I want it when the window is resized. I plan to fix that.
</p><p>
  Meanwhile, expect a lot more breaking in the future.
