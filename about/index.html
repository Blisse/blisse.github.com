				Hi I'm Victor Lai, a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, Canada. I like making stuff, and really, I love making stuff that looks great and works well.

				I use this site to just write stuff, and see how my view in design grows throughout time. You can see what I mean in <a href="/work/site/">my site history</a> page.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm still trying to figure out how I fit in this world, so I'll be exploring all sorts of avenues of programming.
			</p>
			<p>
				From what I've learned so far, I'm not sure that web development is for me, though I really love the idea of really sleek, modernly designed sites. I'll have to test the waters a bit more. For now though I'm trying to apply my knowledge to mobile devices to really see how to make something really functional in another medium.

				Who knows what else in the future. Just enjoying the ride.
