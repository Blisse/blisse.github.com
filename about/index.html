				Hi! My name is Victor Lai. I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Right now, I'm an Agile Engineering co-op at Pivotal Labs, living in Toronto.

				I love learning. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No seriously, I do. I'm a huge fan of responsible learning, understanding the responsibilities you have as you receive and use the knowledge you're given.
			</p>
			<p>
				Software Engineering makes sense then. I also love making stuff. You can't beat the satisfaction of pounding your head at a missing semicolon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I love having things .. work, but more importantly I try to push for <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/talks/how-designers-destroyed-the-world/">responsible design</a>, and push for the understanding the consequences of development and design. All the while, I enjoy fine-tuning my code to make it all the more usable to the end user (UI/UX), or to other developers (maintainability). I still have a lot to learn. Good thing I love learning.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not neck-deep in random programming activities, I'm off screwing my head back on. Sometimes, that involves working out, running, learning kendo, learning to play the guitar. Other times, it'll be falling asleep with my Kobo on my head, catching up on my tech news, looking for new music (there's too much music out there!), or trying out some other new hobby or pushing some other limit (this month: sleeping early and getting up early).
