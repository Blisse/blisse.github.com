			Hi, I'm a 19 year old Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I am passionate about learning, challenging myself, and I'm not afraid of pushing my limits.
		</p>
		<p>
			I write about anything I'm interested in, if only to keep up my writing skills. Also it's nice to see how I've grown over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was first exposed to programming in Grade 10. I really enjoyed programming in Grade 11, but never knew that was where I would end up, so I went into Grade 12 not knowing where to go after I graduated. When I was self-learning programming for Waterloo's Canadian Computing Contest, something clicked for me with programming, and I went to Waterloo, not knowing exactly why. After an interview in my first year, something just <a href="http://www.laivictor.com/archive/2012/04/14/index.html">clicked</a> in my mind. That interview was in March 2012.
		</p>
		<p>
			I understand now what programming means to me, and why it clicked. And I love it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy simple, functional and aesthetically pleasing designs, I program and I create things with the belief that if I make something I like using, I am sure someone else will like it as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I'm not coding, I am <code>gaming</code>,
			learning the <code>guitar</code>,
			practicing <code>Kendo</code> or <code>Badminton</code>,
			going for a <code>run</code> or
			listening to <code>music</code>.
		</p>

			My alias is Bliss \'blis\, which is not only my favourite <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bliss" target="_blank">
			word</a>, but also one of my favourite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMqsWc8muj8" target="_blank">songs</a>.
