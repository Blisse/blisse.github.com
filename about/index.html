				My alias is Bliss \'blis\, which is not only my favourite <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bliss">
				word</a>, but also one of my favourite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMqsWc8muj8">songs</a>.

					I'm Victor Lai, a 19 year old software developer sometimes in Toronto, Canada but usually at the University of Waterloo. I love music, technology, cat pictures, writing, reading, meditating, and running.
				</p>
				<p>
					I aim to be the most intense that I can be at anything I do, while keeping the part of me that keeps me relaxed. And I love pushing my limits every single time.

					In particular, I love playing <strong>badminton</strong>. I recently started some <strong>kendo</strong> and love it. While I've always <strong>swam</strong> and <strong>ran</strong>, I'm learning my way around the <strong>gym</strong> now.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm a huge supporter of Windows, despite it losing its complete dominance, and despite being a programmer (apparently it's a sin?). My favourite language by far is still Python, though I'm stuck in the space between 2.7 and 3.x. Of course, English comes a close second.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everything interests me. Sometimes it gets distracting and I have to purposely zone out things. But I enjoy having the flexibility of actually making that decision.

				I use this site to preserve my life &mdash; lessons that change me, random musings about myself, some other stuff I want to change people with. And to keep track of some cool things.
