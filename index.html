                Hi! I'm Victor Lai, a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. This is where I collect my thoughts.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm bored, I code things, and learn whatever new interest has caught my eye. I'm passionate about making good things for both users and coders, and just as importantly, making things that do good.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than that, I love learning. This year, it's skating into hockey, running, working out, guitar, and helping out.
            </p>
