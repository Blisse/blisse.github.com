					There once was an inflatable boy and an inflatable girl. They went to an inflatable school, where all the teachers were inflatable, all the buildings were inflatable, and all the students were inflatable.
				</p>
				<p>
					One day, the inflatable boy wondered - well, what if the whole world's inflatable? And what if everyone's inflatable and deflatable? And you know when you inflate someone, because they go like this *happy face, rises up a bit* and you know when you deflate someone, because they go like this *sad face, droops down*
				</p>
				<p>
					And maybe, if you inflate lots of people - maybe then you know you've lived a good life. And maybe....maybe, if you can still inflate people after you're gone, then you've lived an even better one.

					There is no time management in my opinion.Take all the stuff that gets you away from work, and just get rid of it. I find that a lot of people are finding something to do that's not doing homework or drawing or painting or something relevant that comes from maybe looking at Facebook, or playing a video game, or eating too long.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's not time management, that's wasting time. That's doing something you shouldn't be doing. You should know if you are going on Facebook for half an hour, that's not work. If I eat for too long, that's not work. Especially if you are a student, if you are student, you shouldn't do any of this stuff. You are paying tuition to go a school, why would you not do school work?
