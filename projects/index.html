		<h3><a href="/projects/ogltictactoe/">Tic-Tac-Toe with OpenGLUT</a></h3>

		<p>
		  I always looked at my console tic-tac-toe implementations with such disdain, mainly because you can't 
		  point and click to place down a piece. I decided one day to do something about that, and while I'm 
		  trying something new, might as well try something REALLY new, and go take a giant peek at one of those things
		  I never really understood, OpenGL.
		</p>

		<h3><a href="/projects/justified/">Ridiculously Justified Lines</a></h3>

		<p>
		  I did this for my programming class. It's a ridiculously complex implementation, but it works. 
		  The main issue was that there's really no simple way to find the next character that wasn't a space
		  in C++ without using confusing substring searches. So I decided to just implement it directly.
