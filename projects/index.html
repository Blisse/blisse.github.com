				</a>
			</h2>
		</p>

			I always looked at my console tic-tac-toe implementations with such disdain, mainly because you can't point and click to place down a piece. I decided one day to do something about that, and while I'm trying something new, might as well try something REALLY new, and go take a giant peek at one of those things I never really understood, OpenGL.

			<h2>
				<a href="/projects/justified/">
					<span class="h2-hover">Justifying Lines in C++</span>
				</a>
			</h2>
		</p>

			This was an problem in my introduction to programming class. I searched online for something like this, but nothing else existed, so here's mine. The logic is very simple, though the steps are pretty hard to follow. I wish I could have taken advantage of the String search methods, but they proved too complex at the time of writing this.
