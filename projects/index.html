		<h2><a href="/projects/ogltictactoe/">Tic-Tac-Toe in OpenGLUT</a></h2>

		<p>
		  I always looked at my console tic-tac-toe implementations with such disdain, mainly because you can't 
		  point and click to place down a piece. I decided one day to do something about that, and while I'm 
		  trying something new, might as well try something REALLY new, and go take a giant peek at one of those things
		  I never really understood, OpenGL.
		</p>

		<h2><a href="/projects/justified/">Justifying Lines in C++</a></h2>

		<p>
		  This was an problem in my programming class. I searched online for something like this, but nothing else existed, 
		  so here you go! The logic is very simple, though the steps are pretty hard to follow. I wish I could have taken advantage
		  of the String search methods, but they proved too complex at the time.
