title: Tic-Tac-Toe with OpenGLUT
tab: ogltictactoe
---

<p>
  This is a 99% complete tic-tac-toe game I made in OpenGL with OpenGLUT.
  I say it's 99% because I haven't implemented keyboard actions beyond quitting via ESC,
  and I don't plan to. This is enough for a small taste of OpenGL, and while 
  there was a lot to learn, it just never felt right to program in.
</p>

<p>
  OpenGL relies heavily on matrices to draw onto the screen, something that I'm not 
  familiar with at all. My implementation of it is extremely simple, and most of all, 2D.

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
</p>

<p> 
  The basic game for a programmer is a console tic-tac-toe games, which really isn't 
  that hard. So why don't I step it up a notch? I learn OpenGL, I include 3 levels of 
  AI difficulty and the ability to select X or O. I'm pretty happy with the end result, knowledge and program-wise.

  <h3>D3D v. OpenGL</h3>
</p>

<p>
  OpenGL was always really interesting to me, partially because of my long time playing Counter-Strike.
  Because I am a tinkerer, I always venture into the game settings to take a look at what options are available..
  A very interesting observation I remember, is that there were at least two options in the video settings. D3D and OpenGL.
</p>

<p>
  As a kid, I never really knew what they were, but one day when I had some free time to think about what to program, all
  these thoughts of Counter-Strike rushed back at me, and I decided to take a farther look at OpenGL solutions.
  This is the result, and I will save DirectX for another time.
</p>

<p>
  I now realize that there was and still is a huge debate between using the two API's, and while I'm 
  not entirely sure exactly what's going on, I still find it very interesting, and maybe you will 
  <a href="http://user.xmission.com/~legalize/d3d-vs-opengl.html" target="_blank">too</a>. DirectX is winning by 
  a huge margin though at the moment because of how hard Microsoft has pushed it forward, though some believe
  if we had only gone OpenGL to begin with, our rendering technology would be leaps and bounds where it is today.
