<h3><a href="/">Tic-Tac-Toe with OpenGLUT</a></h3>

<p>
  This is a 99% complete tic-tac-toe game I made in OpenGL with OpenGLUT.
  I say it's 99% because I haven't implemented keyboard actions beyond quitting,
  and I don't really plan to. This is enough for a small taste of OpenGL, and while 
  there was a lot to learn, it just never felt right. 
</p>

<p>
  OpenGL relies heavily on matrices to draw onto the screen, something that I'm not 
  100% familiar with. My implementation is extremely simple, and most of all, 2D.
<p>

<p> 
  My motivation? Everyone always makes tic-tac-toe console games, which really isn't 
  that hard. So why don't I step it up to the next level? I include 3 levels of 
  AI difficulty and the ability to select X or O. I'm pretty happy with the end result.

  OpenGL was always really interesting to me, partially because of my long time playing Counter-Strike.
  Because I am and have always been a tinkerer, I always venture into the game settings to take a gander.
  A very interesting observation I remember, is that there were at least two options in the video settings.

<p>
  As a kid, I never really knew what this was, but when I was deciding what to make this game with, 
  memories of those video settings rushed back at me (I may or may not have been playing Counter-Strike),
  and I decided to take a farther look at OpenGL.

<p>
  I now realize that there was and still is a huge debate between using the two API, and while I'm 
  not entirely sure exactly what's going on, I still find it very interesting, and maybe you will
