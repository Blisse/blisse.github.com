			This is the latest version of my personal Youtube Subscription Manager. It looks a lot like Youtube, but gives me the option of filtering out the uploaders I don't want to see, and opens the video in a web browser.

			I have 200+ Youtube videos a day in Youtube's My Subscriptions feed. I can't possibly go through them all before the end of the day, because the bottom videos disappear once the list is greater than 200 (why 200!?!). My current solution, save the HTML feed of the subscriptions list, and load them later at another time. It's not the greatest, but it helps a lot.

			For the moment, I decided to slow down with all the music because it was consuming my life, so I've stop using this. However, if I ever get back into this, I would look for even better Youtube integration by hooking up to the Google SDK. From what I've found, there isn't a great API/library for C# available, and Youtube doesn't really have the best API support for 'My Subscriptions', so this may be impossible, but I'd like to take a look in the future.
