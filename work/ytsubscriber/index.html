			This is the latest version of my personal Youtube Subscription Manager. It looks a lot like Youtube, but gives me the option of filtering out the uploaders I don't want to see, and opens a web browser to view a video. There's more functionality to be added for sure. Maybe even hooking it up to Youtube's API, adding more filter options, or Add to Playlist functionality.

			I have 200+ Youtube videos a day in Youtube's My Subscriptions feed. I can't possibly go through them all before the end of the day, because the bottom videos disappear once the list is greater than 200 (why 200!?!). My current solution, save the HTML feed of the subscriptions list, and load them later at another time. It's not the greatest, but it helps vastly.
